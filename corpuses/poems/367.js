  "And put a sack within the hole, and lie",
  "Till the old grunting badger passes bye.",
  "He comes and hears--they let the strongest loose.",
  "The old fox hears the noise and drops the goose.",
  "The poacher shoots and hurries from the cry,",
  "And the old hare half wounded buzzes bye.",
  "They get a forked stick to bear him down",
  "And clap the dogs and take him to the town,",
  "And bait him all the day with many dogs,",
  "And laugh and shout and fright the scampering hogs.",
  "He runs along and bites at all he meets:",

  "Though scarcely half as big, demure and small,",
  "He fights with dogs for bones and beats them all.",
  "The heavy mastiff, savage in the fray,",
  "Lies down and licks his feet and turns away.",
  "The bulldog knows his match and waxes cold,",
  "The badger grins and never leaves his hold.",

  "The frighted women take the boys away,",
  "The blackguard laughs and hurries on the fray.",
  "He tries to reach the woods, an awkward race,",
  "But sticks and cudgels quickly stop the chace.",
  "He turns agen and drives the noisy crowd",
  "And beats the many dogs in noises loud.",
  "He drives away and beats them every one,",
  "And then they loose them all and set them on.",
  "He falls as dead and kicked by boys and men,",
  "Then starts and grins and drives the crowd agen;",
  "Till kicked and torn and beaten out he lies",
  "And leaves his hold and cackles, groans, and dies.",
