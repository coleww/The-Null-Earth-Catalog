  "Darkness like midnight from the sobbing woods",

  "Through night's black depths in danger's garb arrayed.",
  "And the loud glabber round the flaze soon stops",
  "When hushed to silence by the lifted hand",
  "Of fearing dame who hears the noise in dread",
  "And thinks a deluge comes to drown the land;",
  "Nor dares she go to bed until the tempest drops.",
