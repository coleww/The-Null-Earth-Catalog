  "Month which the warring ancients strangely styled",
  "The month of war,--as if in their fierce ways",
  "Were any month of peace!--in thy rough days",
  "I find no war in Nature, though the wild",
  "Winds clash and clang, and broken boughs are piled",
  "As feet of writhing trees. The violets raise",
  "Their heads without affright, without amaze,",
  "And sleep through all the din, as sleeps a child.",
  "And he who watches well may well discern",
  "Sweet expectation in each living thing.",
  "Like pregnant mother the sweet earth doth yearn;",
  "In secret joy makes ready for the spring;",
  "And hidden, sacred, in her breast doth bear",
  "Annunciation lilies for the year.",
