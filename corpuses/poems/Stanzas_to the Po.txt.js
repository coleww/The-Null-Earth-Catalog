  "  Where dwells the Lady of my love, when she",
  "Walks by thy brink, and there perchance recalls",
  "  A faint and fleeting memory of me:",
  "",
  "What if thy deep and ample stream should be",
  "  A mirror of my heart, where she may read",
  "The thousand thoughts I now betray to thee,",
  "  Wild as thy wave, and headlong as thy speed!",
  "",
  "What do I say--a mirror of my heart?",
  "  Are not thy waters sweeping, dark, and strong?",
  "Such as my feelings were and are, thou art;",
  "  And such as thou art were my passions long.",

  "Time may have somewhat tamed them,--not for ever;",
  "  Thou overflow'st thy banks, and not for aye",
  "Thy bosom overboils, congenial river!",
  "  Thy floods subside, and mine have sunk away:",
  "",
  "But left long wrecks behind, and now again,",
  "  Borne in our old unchanged career, we move:",
  "Thou tendest wildly onwards to the main,",
  "  And I--to loving _one_ I should not love.",

  "The current I behold will sweep beneath",
  "  Her native walls, and murmur at her feet;",

  "  That happy wave repass me in its flow!",

  "The wave that bears my tears returns no more:",
  "  Will she return by whom that wave shall sweep?--",
  "Both tread thy banks, both wander on thy shore,",
  "  I by thy source, she by the dark-blue deep.",

  "But that which keepeth us apart is not",
  "  Distance, nor depth of wave, nor space of earth,",
  "But the distraction of a various lot,",
  "  As various as the climates of our birth.",

  "A stranger loves the Lady of the land,",
  "  Born far beyond the mountains, but his blood",
  "Is all meridian, as if never fanned",
  "  By the black wind that chills the polar flood.",

  "My blood is all meridian; were it not,",
  "  I had not left my clime, nor should I be,",
  "In spite of tortures, ne'er to be forgot,",
  "  A slave again of love,--at least of thee.",
  "",
  "'Tis vain to struggle--let me perish young--",
  "  Live as I lived, and love as I have loved;",
  "To dust if I return, from dust I sprung,",
  "  And then, at least, my heart can ne'er be moved.",
