  "As olde bookes make mentioun,",
  "He was the moste lusty bacheler",
  "Of all this world, and eke the best archer.",
  "He slew Python the serpent, as he lay",
  "Sleeping against the sun upon a day;",
  "And many another noble worthy deed",
  "He with his bow wrought, as men maye read.",

  "Could never singe half so well as he.",
  "Thereto he was the seemlieste man",
  "That is, or was since that the world began;",
  "What needeth it his features to descrive?",
  "For in this world is none so fair alive.",

  "Now had this Phoebus in his house a crow,",
  "Which in a cage he foster'd many a day,",
  "And taught it speaken, as men teach a jay.",
  "White was this crow, as is a snow-white swan,",

  "Therewith in all this world no nightingale",
  "Ne coulde by an hundred thousand deal",
  "Singe so wondrous merrily and well.",
  "Now had this Phoebus in his house a wife;",
