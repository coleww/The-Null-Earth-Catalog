  "So I, a thing whom moralists call worm,",
  "Sit spinning still round this decaying form,",
  "From the fine threads of rare and subtle thought--",
  "No net of words in garish colours wrought",
  "To catch the idle buzzers of the day--",
  "But a soft cell, where when that fades away,",
  "Memory may clothe in wings my living name",
  "And feed it with the asphodels of fame,",
  "Which in those hearts which must remember me",
  "Grow, making love an immortality.",
  "",
  "Whoever should behold me now, I wist,",
  "Would think I were a mighty mechanist,",
  "Bent with sublime Archimedean art",
  "To breathe a soul into the iron heart",
  "Of some machine portentous, or strange gin,",
  "Which by the force of figured spells might win",
  "Its way over the sea, and sport therein;",
  "For round the walls are hung dread engines, such",

  "Ixion or the Titan:--or the quick",
  "Wit of that man of God, St. Dominic,",
  "To convince Atheist, Turk, or Heretic,",

  "With thumbscrews, wheels, with tooth and spike and jag,",
  "Which fishers found under the utmost crag",
  "Of Cornwall and the storm-encompassed isles,",
  "Where to the sky the rude sea rarely smiles",
  "Unless in treacherous wrath, as on the morn",
  "When the exulting elements in scorn,",
  "Satiated with destroyed destruction, lay",
  "Sleeping in beauty on their mangled prey,",
  "As panthers sleep;--and other strange and dread",
  "Magical forms the brick floor overspread,--",
  "Proteus transformed to metal did not make",
  "More figures, or more strange; nor did he take",
  "Such shapes of unintelligible brass,",
  "Or heap himself in such a horrid mass",

  "And forms of unimaginable wood,",
  "To puzzle Tubal Cain and all his brood:",
  "Great screws, and cones, and wheels, and grooved blocks,",
  "The elements of what will stand the shocks",
  "Of wave and wind and time.--Upon the table",
  "More knacks and quips there be than I am able",
  "To catalogize in this verse of mine:--",
  "A pretty bowl of wood--not full of wine,",
  "But quicksilver; that dew which the gnomes drink",
  "When at their subterranean toil they swink,",
  "Pledging the demons of the earthquake, who",
  "Reply to them in lava--cry halloo!",
  "And call out to the cities o'er their head,--",
  "Roofs, towers, and shrines, the dying and the dead,",
  "Crash through the chinks of earth--and then all quaff",
  "Another rouse, and hold their sides and laugh.",
  "This quicksilver no gnome has drunk--within",
  "The walnut bowl it lies, veined and thin,",
  "In colour like the wake of light that stains",
  "The Tuscan deep, when from the moist moon rains",
  "The inmost shower of its white fire--the breeze",
  "Is still--blue Heaven smiles over the pale seas.",
  "And in this bowl of quicksilver--for I",
  "Yield to the impulse of an infancy",
  "Outlasting manhood--I have made to float",
  "A rude idealism of a paper boat:--",
  "A hollow screw with cogs--Henry will know",
  "The thing I mean and laugh at me,--if so",
  "He fears not I should do more mischief.--Next",
  "Lie bills and calculations much perplexed,",
  "With steam-boats, frigates, and machinery quaint",
  "Traced over them in blue and yellow paint.",
  "Then comes a range of mathematical",
  "Instruments, for plans nautical and statical,",
  "A heap of rosin, a queer broken glass",
  "With ink in it;--a china cup that was",
  "What it will never be again, I think,--",
  "A thing from which sweet lips were wont to drink",
  "The liquor doctors rail at--and which I",
  "Will quaff in spite of them--and when we die",
  "We'll toss up who died first of drinking tea,",
  "And cry out,--'Heads or tails?' where'er we be.",
  "Near that a dusty paint-box, some odd hooks,",
  "A half-burnt match, an ivory block, three books,",
  "Where conic sections, spherics, logarithms,",
  "To great Laplace, from Saunderson and Sims,",
  "Lie heaped in their harmonious disarray",
  "Of figures,--disentangle them who may.",
  "Baron de Tott's Memoirs beside them lie,",
  "And some odd volumes of old chemistry.",

  "I'll leave, as Spenser says, with many mo,",
  "This secret in the pregnant womb of time,",
  "Too vast a matter for so weak a rhyme.",
  "",
  "And here like some weird Archimage sit I,",
  "Plotting dark spells, and devilish enginery,",
  "The self-impelling steam-wheels of the mind",
  "Which pump up oaths from clergymen, and grind",
  "The gentle spirit of our meek reviews",
  "Into a powdery foam of salt abuse,",
  "Ruffling the ocean of their self-content;--",
  "I sit--and smile or sigh as is my bent,",
  "But not for them--Libeccio rushes round",
  "With an inconstant and an idle sound,",
  "I heed him more than them--the thunder-smoke",
  "Is gathering on the mountains, like a cloak",
  "Folded athwart their shoulders broad and bare;",
  "The ripe corn under the undulating air",
  "Undulates like an ocean;--and the vines",
  "Are trembling wide in all their trellised lines--",
  "The murmur of the awakening sea doth fill",
  "The empty pauses of the blast;--the hill",
  "Looks hoary through the white electric rain,",
  "And from the glens beyond, in sullen strain,",
  "The interrupted thunder howls; above",
  "One chasm of Heaven smiles, like the eye of Love",
  "On the unquiet world;--while such things are,",
  "How could one worth your friendship heed the war",
  "Of worms? the shriek of the world's carrion jays,",
  "Their censure, or their wonder, or their praise?",

  "But I, an old diviner, who knew well",
  "Every false verse of that sweet oracle,",
  "Turned to the sad enchantress once again,",
  "And sought a respite from my gentle pain,",
  "In citing every passage o'er and o'er",
  "Of our communion--how on the sea-shore",
  "We watched the ocean and the sky together,",
  "Under the roof of blue Italian weather;",
  "How I ran home through last year's thunder-storm,",
  "And felt the transverse lightning linger warm",
  "Upon my cheek--and how we often made",
  "Feasts for each other, where good will outweighed",
  "The frugal luxury of our country cheer,",

  "Of all we would believe, and sadly blame",
  "The jarring and inexplicable frame",

  "The issue of the earth's great business,",
  "When we shall be as we no longer are--",
  "Like babbling gossips safe, who hear the war",
  "Of winds, and sigh, but tremble not;--or how",
  "You listened to some interrupted flow",
  "Of visionary rhyme,--in joy and pain",
  "Struck from the inmost fountains of my brain,",
  "With little skill perhaps;--or how we sought",
  "Those deepest wells of passion or of thought",
  "Wrought by wise poets in the waste of years,",
  "Staining their sacred waters with our tears;",
  "Quenching a thirst ever to be renewed!",
  "Or how I, wisest lady! then endued",
  "The language of a land which now is free,",
  "And, winged with thoughts of truth and majesty,",
  "Flits round the tyrant's sceptre like a cloud,",
  "And bursts the peopled prisons, and cries aloud,",
  "'My name is Legion!'--that majestic tongue",
  "Which Calderon over the desert flung",
  "Of ages and of nations; and which found",
  "An echo in our hearts, and with the sound",
  "Startled oblivion;--thou wert then to me",
  "As is a nurse--when inarticulately",
  "A child would talk as its grown parents do.",
  "If living winds the rapid clouds pursue,",

  "You are now",
  "In London, that great sea, whose ebb and flow",
  "At once is deaf and loud, and on the shore",
  "Vomits its wrecks, and still howls on for more.",
  "Yet in its depth what treasures! You will see",
  "That which was Godwin,--greater none than he",
  "Though fallen--and fallen on evil times--to stand",
  "Among the spirits of our age and land,",
  "Before the dread tribunal of \"to come\"",
  "The foremost,--while Rebuke cowers pale and dumb.",
  "You will see Coleridge--he who sits obscure",
  "In the exceeding lustre and the pure",
  "Intense irradiation of a mind,",
  "Which, with its own internal lightning blind,",
  "Flags wearily through darkness and despair--",
  "A cloud-encircled meteor of the air,",
  "A hooded eagle among blinking owls.--",
  "You will see Hunt--one of those happy souls",
  "Which are the salt of the earth, and without whom",
  "This world would smell like what it is--a tomb;",
  "Who is, what others seem; his room no doubt",
  "Is still adorned with many a cast from Shout,",
  "With graceful flowers tastefully placed about;",
  "And coronals of bay from ribbons hung,",
  "And brighter wreaths in neat disorder flung;",
  "The gifts of the most learned among some dozens",
  "Of female friends, sisters-in-law, and cousins.",
  "And there is he with his eternal puns,",
  "Which beat the dullest brain for smiles, like duns",
  "Thundering for money at a poet's door;",

  "Within which they inhabit;--of his wit",
  "And wisdom, you'll cry out when you are bit.",
  "He is a pearl within an oyster shell.",
  "One of the richest of the deep;--and there",
  "Is English Peacock, with his mountain Fair,",
  "Turned into a Flamingo;--that shy bird",
  "That gleams i' the Indian air--have you not heard",
  "When a man marries, dies, or turns Hindoo,",
  "His best friends hear no more of him?--but you",
  "Will see him, and will like him too, I hope,",
  "With the milk-white Snowdonian Antelope",

  "Makes such a wound, the knife is lost in it;",
  "A strain too learned for a shallow age,",
  "Too wise for selfish bigots; let his page,",
  "Which charms the chosen spirits of the time,",
  "Fold itself up for the serener clime",
  "Of years to come, and find its recompense",
  "In that just expectation.--Wit and sense,",
  "Virtue and human knowledge; all that might",
  "Make this dull world a business of delight,",
  "Are all combined in Horace Smith.--And these.",

  "I recall",
  "My thoughts, and bid you look upon the night.",
  "As water does a sponge, so the moonlight",

  "What see you?--unpavilioned Heaven is fair,",
  "Whether the moon, into her chamber gone,",
  "Leaves midnight to the golden stars, or wan",

  "All this is beautiful in every land.--",
  "But what see you beside?--a shabby stand",
  "Of Hackney coaches--a brick house or wall",
  "Fencing some lonely court, white with the scrawl",
  "Of our unhappy politics;--or worse--",
  "A wretched woman reeling by, whose curse",
  "Mixed with the watchman's, partner of her trade,",

  "To Henry, some unutterable thing.",
  "I see a chaos of green leaves and fruit",
  "Built round dark caverns, even to the root",
  "Of the living stems that feed them--in whose bowers",
  "There sleep in their dark dew the folded flowers;",
  "Beyond, the surface of the unsickled corn",
  "Trembles not in the slumbering air, and borne",
  "In circles quaint, and ever-changing dance,",
  "Like winged stars the fire-flies flash and glance,",
  "Pale in the open moonshine, but each one",
  "Under the dark trees seems a little sun,",
  "A meteor tamed; a fixed star gone astray",
  "From the silver regions of the milky way;--",
  "Afar the Contadino's song is heard,",
  "Rude, but made sweet by distance--and a bird",
  "Which cannot be the Nightingale, and yet",
  "I know none else that sings so sweet as it",
  "At this late hour;--and then all is still--",
  "Now--Italy or London, which you will!",
  "",
  "Next winter you must pass with me; I'll have",
  "My house by that time turned into a grave",
  "Of dead despondence and low-thoughted care,",
  "And all the dreams which our tormentors are;",

  "With everything belonging to them fair!--",
  "We will have books, Spanish, Italian, Greek;",
  "And ask one week to make another week",
  "As like his father, as I'm unlike mine,",
  "Which is not his fault, as you may divine.",
  "Though we eat little flesh and drink no wine,",
  "Yet let's be merry: we'll have tea and toast;",
  "Custards for supper, and an endless host",
  "Of syllabubs and jellies and mince-pies,",
  "And other such lady-like luxuries,--",
  "Feasting on which we will philosophize!",
  "And we'll have fires out of the Grand Duke's wood,",
  "To thaw the six weeks' winter in our blood.",
  "And then we'll talk;--what shall we talk about?",
  "Oh! there are themes enough for many a bout",
  "Of thought-entangled descant;--as to nerves--",
  "With cones and parallelograms and curves",
  "I've sworn to strangle them if once they dare",
  "To bother me--when you are with me there.",
  "And they shall never more sip laudanum,",
  "From Helicon or Himeros (1);--well, come,",
  "And in despite of God and of the devil,",
  "We'll make our friendly philosophic revel",
  "Outlast the leafless time; till buds and flowers",
  "Warn the obscure inevitable hours,",
  "Sweet meeting by sad parting to renew;--",
  "'To-morrow to fresh woods and pastures new.'",
