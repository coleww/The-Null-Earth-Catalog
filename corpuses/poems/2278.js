  "A Story of Christmas Eve.",
  "",
  "Strange that the termagant winds should scold",
  "The Christmas Eve so bitterly!",
  "But Wife, and Harry the four-year-old,",
  "Big Charley, Nimblewits, and I,",
  "",
  "Blithe as the wind was bitter, drew",
  "More frontward of the mighty fire,",
  "Where wise Newfoundland Fan foreknew",
  "The heaven that Christian dogs desire --",
  "",
  "Stretched o'er the rug, serene and grave,",
  "Huge nose on heavy paws reclined,",
  "With never a drowning boy to save,",
  "And warmth of body and peace of mind.",
  "",
  "And, as our happy circle sat,",
  "The fire well capp'd the company:",
  "In grave debate or careless chat,",
  "A right good fellow, mingled he:",
  "",
  "He seemed as one of us to sit,",
  "And talked of things above, below,",
  "With flames more winsome than our wit,",
  "And coals that burned like love aglow.",
  "",
  "While thus our rippling discourse rolled",
  "Smooth down the channel of the night,",
  "We spoke of Time: thereat, one told",
  "A parable of the Seasons' flight.",
  "",
  "\"Time was a Shepherd with four sheep.",
  "In a certain Field he long abode.",
  "He stood by the bars, and his flock bade leap",
  "One at a time to the Common Road.",
  "",
  "\"And first there leapt, like bird on wing,",
  "A lissome Lamb that played in the air.",
  "I heard the Shepherd call him `Spring':",
  "Oh, large-eyed, fresh and snowy fair",
  "",
  "\"He skipped the flowering Highway fast,",
  "Hurried the hedgerows green and white,",
  "Set maids and men a-yearning, passed",
  "The Bend, and gamboll'd out of sight.",
  "",
  "\"And next marched forth a matron Ewe",
  "(While Time took down a bar for her),",
  "Udder'd so large 'twas much ado",
  "E'en then to clear the barrier.",
  "",
  "\"Full softly shone her silken fleece",
  "What stately time she paced along:",
  "Each heartsome hoof-stroke wrought increase",
  "Of sunlight, substance, seedling, song,",
  "",
  "\"In flower, in fruit, in field, in bird,",
  "Till the great globe, rich fleck'd and pied,",
  "Like some large peach half pinkly furred,",
  "Turned to the sun a glowing side",
  "",
  "\"And hung in the heavenly orchard, bright,",
  "None-such, complete.",
  "Then, while the Ewe",
  "Slow passed the Bend, a blur of light,",
  "The Shepherd's face in sadness grew:",
  "",
  "\"`Summer!' he said, as one would say",
  "A sigh in syllables. So, in haste",
  "(For shame of Summer's long delay,",
  "Yet gazing still what way she paced),",
  "",
  "\"He summoned Autumn, slanting down",
  "The second bar. Thereover strode",
  "A Wether, fleeced in burning brown,",
  "And largely loitered down the Road.",
  "",
  "\"Far as the farmers sight his shape",
  "Majestic moving o'er the way,",
  "All cry `To harvest,' crush the grape,",
  "And haul the corn and house the hay,",
  "",
  "\"Till presently, no man can say,",
  "(So brown the woods that line that end)",
  "If yet the brown-fleeced Wether may,",
  "Or not, have passed beyond the Bend.",
  "",
  "\"Now turn I towards the Shepherd: lo,",
  "An aged Ram, flapp'd, gnarly-horn'd,",
  "With bones that crackle o'er the snow,",
  "Rheum'd, wind-gall'd, rag-fleec'd, burr'd and thorn'd.",
  "",
  "\"Time takes the third bar off for him,",
  "He totters down the windy lane.",
  "'Tis Winter, still: the Bend lies dim.",
  "O Lamb, would thou wouldst leap again!\"",
  "",
  "Those seasons out, we talked of these:",
  "And I (with inward purpose sly",
  "To shield my purse from Christmas trees",
  "And stockings and wild robbery",
  "",
  "When Hal and Nimblewits invade",
  "My cash in Santa Claus's name)",
  "In full the hard, hard times surveyed;",
  "Denounced all waste as crime and shame;",
  "",
  "Hinted that \"waste\" might be a term",
  "Including skates, velocipedes,",
  "Kites, marbles, soldiers, towers infirm,",
  "Bows, arrows, cannon, Indian reeds,",
  "",
  "Cap-pistols, drums, mechanic toys,",
  "And all th' infernal host of horns",
  "Whereby to strenuous hells of noise",
  "Are turned the blessed Christmas morns;",
  "",
  "Thus, roused -- those horns! -- to sacred rage,",
  "I rose, forefinger high in air,",
  "When Harry cried (SOME war to wage),",
  "\"Papa, is hard times ev'ywhere?",
  "",
  "\"Maybe in Santa Claus's land",
  "It isn't hard times none at all!\"",
  "Now, blessed Vision! to my hand",
  "Most pat, a marvel strange did fall.",
  "",
  "Scarce had my Harry ceased, when \"Look!\"",
  "He cried, leapt up in wild alarm,",
  "Ran to my Comrade, shelter took",
  "Beneath the startled mother's arm.",
  "",
  "And so was still: what time we saw",
  "A foot hang down the fireplace! Then,",
  "With painful scrambling scratched and raw,",
  "Two hands that seemed like hands of men",
  "",
  "Eased down two legs and a body through",
  "The blazing fire, and forth there came",
  "Before our wide and wondering view",
  "A figure shrinking half with shame,",
  "",
  "And half with weakness. \"Sir,\" I said,",
  "-- But with a mien of dignity",
  "The seedy stranger raised his head:",
  "\"My friends, I'm Santa Claus,\" said he.",
  "",
  "But oh, how changed! That rotund face",
  "The new moon rivall'd, pale and thin;",
  "Where once was cheek, now empty space;",
  "Whate'er stood out, did now stand in.",
  "",
  "His piteous legs scarce propped him up:",
  "His arms mere sickles seemed to be:",
  "But most o'erflowed our sorrow's cup",
  "When that we saw -- or did not see --",
  "",
  "His belly: we remembered how",
  "It shook like a bowl of jelly fine:",
  "An earthquake could not shake it now;",
  "He HAD no belly -- not a sign.",
  "",
  "\"Yes, yes, old friends, you well may stare:",
  "I HAVE seen better days,\" he said:",
  "\"But now, with shrinkage, loss and care,",
  "Your Santa Claus scarce owns his head.",
  "",
  "\"We've had such hard, hard times this year",
  "For goblins! Never knew the like.",
  "All Elfland's mortgaged! And we fear",
  "The gnomes are just about to strike.",
  "",
  "\"I once was rich, and round, and hale.",
  "The whole world called me jolly brick;",
  "But listen to a piteous tale.",
  "Young Harry, -- Santa Claus is sick!",
  "",
  "\"'Twas thus: a smooth-tongued railroad man",
  "Comes to my house and talks to me:",

  "That suits this nineteenth century.",
  "",
  "\"`Instead of driving, as you do,",
  "Six reindeer slow from house to house,",
  "Let's build a Grand Trunk Railway through",
  "From here to earth's last terminus.",
  "",
  "\"`We'll touch at every chimney-top",
  "(An Elevated Track, of course),",
  "Then, as we whisk you by, you'll drop",
  "Each package down: just think, the force",
  "",
  "\"`You'll save, the time! -- Besides, we'll make",

  "Dame Fortune's bales of good and ill",
  "",
  "\"`(Why, she's the biggest shipper, sir,",

  "",
  "\"`When ghosts return to walk with men,",
  "We'll bring 'em cheap by steam, and fast:",
  "We'll run a Branch to heaven! and then",
  "We'll riot, man; for then, at last",
  "",
  "\"`We'll make with heaven a contract fair",
  "To call, each hour, from town to town,",
  "And carry the dead folks' souls up there,",

  "",
  "\"The plan seemed fair: I gave him cash,",
  "Nay, every penny I could raise.",

  "How could I know the stock-thief's ways?",
  "",
  "\"But soon I learned full well, poor fool!",
  "My woes began, that wretched day.",
  "The President plied me like a tool.",
  "In lawyer's fees, and rights of way,",
  "",
  "\"Injunctions, leases, charters, I",
  "Was meshed as in a mighty maze.",
  "The stock ran low, the talk ran high:",
  "Then quickly flamed the final blaze.",
  "",
  "\"With never an inch of track -- 'tis true!",
  "The debts were large . . . the oft-told tale.",

  "",
  "Poor Santa Claus burst into tears,",

  "I caught this dreadful hacking cough:",
  "",
  "\"I cut off the tail of my Ulster furred",
