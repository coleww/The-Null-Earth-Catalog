  "TRANSLATED FROM THE GREEK OF HOMER.",
  "",
  "Sing, Muse, the son of Maia and of Jove,",
  "The Herald-child, king of Arcadia",
  "And all its pastoral hills, whom in sweet love",
  "Having been interwoven, modest May",
  "Bore Heaven's dread Supreme. An antique grove",
  "Shadowed the cavern where the lovers lay",
  "In the deep night, unseen by Gods or Men,",
  "And white-armed Juno slumbered sweetly then.",
  "",
  "Now, when the joy of Jove had its fulfilling,",
  "And Heaven's tenth moon chronicled her relief,",
  "She gave to light a babe all babes excelling,",
  "A schemer subtle beyond all belief;",
  "A shepherd of thin dreams, a cow-stealing,",
  "A night-watching, and door-waylaying thief,",
  "Who 'mongst the Gods was soon about to thieve,",
  "And other glorious actions to achieve.",
  "",
  "The babe was born at the first peep of day;",
  "He began playing on the lyre at noon,",
  "And the same evening did he steal away",
  "Apollo's herds;--the fourth day of the moon",
  "On which him bore the venerable May,",
  "From her immortal limbs he leaped full soon,",
  "Nor long could in the sacred cradle keep,",
  "But out to seek Apollo's herds would creep.",
  "",
  "Out of the lofty cavern wandering",
  "He found a tortoise, and cried out--'A treasure!'",
  "(For Mercury first made the tortoise sing)",
  "The beast before the portal at his leisure",
  "The flowery herbage was depasturing,",
  "Moving his feet in a deliberate measure",
  "Over the turf. Jove's profitable son",
  "Eying him laughed, and laughing thus begun:--",
  "",
  "'A useful godsend are you to me now,",
  "King of the dance, companion of the feast,",
  "Lovely in all your nature! Welcome, you",
  "Excellent plaything! Where, sweet mountain-beast,",
  "Got you that speckled shell? Thus much I know,",
  "You must come home with me and be my guest;",
  "You will give joy to me, and I will do",
  "All that is in my power to honour you.",
  "",
  "'Better to be at home than out of door,",
  "So come with me; and though it has been said",
  "That you alive defend from magic power,",
  "I know you will sing sweetly when you're dead.'",
  "Thus having spoken, the quaint infant bore,",
  "Lifting it from the grass on which it fed",
  "And grasping it in his delighted hold,",
  "His treasured prize into the cavern old.",
  "",
  "Then scooping with a chisel of gray steel,",
  "He bored the life and soul out of the beast.--",
  "Not swifter a swift thought of woe or weal",
  "Darts through the tumult of a human breast",
  "Which thronging cares annoy--not swifter wheel",
  "The flashes of its torture and unrest",
  "Out of the dizzy eyes--than Maia's son",
  "All that he did devise hath featly done.",
  "",
  "...",
  "And through the tortoise's hard stony skin",
  "At proper distances small holes he made,",
  "And fastened the cut stems of reeds within,",
  "And with a piece of leather overlaid",
  "The open space and fixed the cubits in,",
  "Fitting the bridge to both, and stretched o'er all",
  "Symphonious cords of sheep-gut rhythmical.",
  "",
  "When he had wrought the lovely instrument,",
  "He tried the chords, and made division meet,",
  "Preluding with the plectrum, and there went",
  "Up from beneath his hand a tumult sweet",
  "Of mighty sounds, and from his lips he sent",
  "A strain of unpremeditated wit",
  "Joyous and wild and wanton--such you may",
  "Hear among revellers on a holiday.",
  "",
  "He sung how Jove and May of the bright sandal",
  "Dallied in love not quite legitimate;",
  "And his own birth, still scoffing at the scandal,",
  "And naming his own name, did celebrate;",
  "His mother's cave and servant maids he planned all",
  "In plastic verse, her household stuff and state,",
  "Perennial pot, trippet, and brazen pan,--",
  "But singing, he conceived another plan.",
  "",
  "...",
  "Seized with a sudden fancy for fresh meat,",
  "He in his sacred crib deposited",
  "The hollow lyre, and from the cavern sweet",
  "Rushed with great leaps up to the mountain's head,",
  "Revolving in his mind some subtle feat",
  "Of thievish craft, such as a swindler might",
  "Devise in the lone season of dun night.",
  "",
  "Lo! the great Sun under the ocean's bed has",
  "Driven steeds and chariot--the child meanwhile strode",
  "O'er the Pierian mountains clothed in shadows,",
  "Where the immortal oxen of the God",
  "Are pastured in the flowering unmown meadows,",
  "And safely stalled in a remote abode.--",
  "The archer Argicide, elate and proud,",
  "Drove fifty from the herd, lowing aloud.",
  "",
  "He drove them wandering o'er the sandy way,",
  "But, being ever mindful of his craft,",
  "Backward and forward drove he them astray,",
  "So that the tracks which seemed before, were aft;",
  "His sandals then he threw to the ocean spray,",
  "And for each foot he wrought a kind of raft",
  "Of tamarisk, and tamarisk-like sprigs,",
  "And bound them in a lump with withy twigs.",
  "",
  "And on his feet he tied these sandals light,",
  "The trail of whose wide leaves might not betray",
  "His track; and then, a self-sufficing wight,",
  "Like a man hastening on some distant way,",
  "He from Pieria's mountain bent his flight;",
  "But an old man perceived the infant pass",
  "Down green Onchestus heaped like beds with grass.",
  "",
  "The old man stood dressing his sunny vine:",
  "'Halloo! old fellow with the crooked shoulder!",
  "You grub those stumps? before they will bear wine",
  "Methinks even you must grow a little older:",
  "Attend, I pray, to this advice of mine,",
  "As you would 'scape what might appal a bolder--",
  "Seeing, see not--and hearing, hear not--and--",
  "If you have understanding--understand.'",
  "",
  "So saying, Hermes roused the oxen vast;",
  "O'er shadowy mountain and resounding dell,",
  "And flower-paven plains, great Hermes passed;",
  "Till the black night divine, which favouring fell",
  "Around his steps, grew gray, and morning fast",
  "Wakened the world to work, and from her cell",
  "Sea-strewn, the Pallantean Moon sublime",
  "Into her watch-tower just began to climb.",
  "",
  "Now to Alpheus he had driven all",
  "The broad-foreheaded oxen of the Sun;",
  "They came unwearied to the lofty stall",
  "And to the water-troughs which ever run",
  "Through the fresh fields--and when with rushgrass tall,",
  "Lotus and all sweet herbage, every one",
  "Had pastured been, the great God made them move",
  "Towards the stall in a collected drove.",
  "",
  "A mighty pile of wood the God then heaped,",
  "And having soon conceived the mystery",
  "Of fire, from two smooth laurel branches stripped",
  "The bark, and rubbed them in his palms;--on high",
  "Suddenly forth the burning vapour leaped",
  "And the divine child saw delightedly.--",
  "Mercury first found out for human weal",
  "Tinder-box, matches, fire-irons, flint and steel.",
  "",
  "And fine dry logs and roots innumerous",
  "He gathered in a delve upon the ground--",
  "And kindled them--and instantaneous",
  "The strength of the fierce flame was breathed around:",
  "And whilst the might of glorious Vulcan thus",
  "Wrapped the great pile with glare and roaring sound,",
  "Hermes dragged forth two heifers, lowing loud,",
  "Close to the fire--such might was in the God.",
  "",
  "And on the earth upon their backs he threw",
  "The panting beasts, and rolled them o'er and o'er,",
  "And bored their lives out. Without more ado",
  "He cut up fat and flesh, and down before",
  "The fire, on spits of wood he placed the two,",
  "Toasting their flesh and ribs, and all the gore",
  "Pursed in the bowels; and while this was done",
  "He stretched their hides over a craggy stone.",
  "",
  "We mortals let an ox grow old, and then",
  "Cut it up after long consideration,--",
  "But joyous-minded Hermes from the glen",
  "Drew the fat spoils to the more open station",
  "Of a flat smooth space, and portioned them; and when",
  "He had by lot assigned to each a ration",
  "Of the twelve Gods, his mind became aware",
  "Of all the joys which in religion are.",
  "",
  "For the sweet savour of the roasted meat",
  "Tempted him though immortal. Natheless",
  "He checked his haughty will and did not eat,",
  "Though what it cost him words can scarce express,",
  "And every wish to put such morsels sweet",
  "Down his most sacred throat, he did repress;",
  "But soon within the lofty portalled stall",
  "He placed the fat and flesh and bones and all.",
  "",
  "And every trace of the fresh butchery",
  "And cooking, the God soon made disappear,",
  "As if it all had vanished through the sky;",
  "He burned the hoofs and horns and head and hair,--",
  "The insatiate fire devoured them hungrily;--",
  "And when he saw that everything was clear,",
  "He quenched the coal, and trampled the black dust,",
  "And in the stream his bloody sandals tossed.",
  "",
  "All night he worked in the serene moonshine--",
  "But when the light of day was spread abroad",
  "He sought his natal mountain-peaks divine.",
  "On his long wandering, neither Man nor God",
  "Had met him, since he killed Apollo's kine,",
  "Nor house-dog had barked at him on his road;",
  "Now he obliquely through the keyhole passed,",
  "Like a thin mist, or an autumnal blast.",
  "",
  "Right through the temple of the spacious cave",
  "He went with soft light feet--as if his tread",
  "Fell not on earth; no sound their falling gave;",
  "Then to his cradle he crept quick, and spread",
  "The swaddling-clothes about him; and the knave",
  "Lay playing with the covering of the bed",
  "With his left hand about his knees--the right",
  "Held his beloved tortoise-lyre tight.",
  "",
  "There he lay innocent as a new-born child,",
  "As gossips say; but though he was a God,",
  "The Goddess, his fair mother, unbeguiled,",
  "Knew all that he had done being abroad:",
  "'Whence come you, and from what adventure wild,",
  "You cunning rogue, and where have you abode",
  "All the long night, clothed in your impudence?",
  "What have you done since you departed hence?",
  "",
  "'Apollo soon will pass within this gate",
  "And bind your tender body in a chain",
  "Inextricably tight, and fast as fate,",
  "Unless you can delude the God again,",
  "Even when within his arms--ah, runagate!",
  "A pretty torment both for Gods and Men",
  "Your father made when he made you!'--'Dear mother,'",
  "Replied sly Hermes, 'wherefore scold and bother?",
  "",
  "'As if I were like other babes as old,",
  "And understood nothing of what is what;",
  "And cared at all to hear my mother scold.",
  "I in my subtle brain a scheme have got,",
  "Which whilst the sacred stars round Heaven are rolled",
  "Will profit you and me--nor shall our lot",
  "Be as you counsel, without gifts or food,",
  "To spend our lives in this obscure abode.",
  "",
  "29",
  "'But we will leave this shadow-peopled cave",
  "And live among the Gods, and pass each day",
  "In high communion, sharing what they have",
  "Of profuse wealth and unexhausted prey;",
  "And from the portion which my father gave",
  "To Phoebus, I will snatch my share away,",
  "Which if my father will not--natheless I,",
  "Who am the king of robbers, can but try.",
  "",
  "'And, if Latona's son should find me out,",
  "I'll countermine him by a deeper plan;",
  "I'll pierce the Pythian temple-walls, though stout,",
  "And sack the fane of everything I can--",
  "Caldrons and tripods of great worth no doubt,",
  "Each golden cup and polished brazen pan,",
  "All the wrought tapestries and garments gay.'--",
  "So they together talked;--meanwhile the Day",
  "",
  "Aethereal born arose out of the flood",
  "Of flowing Ocean, bearing light to men.",
  "Apollo passed toward the sacred wood,",
  "Which from the inmost depths of its green glen",
  "Echoes the voice of Neptune,--and there stood",
  "On the same spot in green Onchestus then",
  "That same old animal, the vine-dresser,",
  "Who was employed hedging his vineyard there.",
  "",
  "Latona's glorious Son began:--'I pray",
  "Tell, ancient hedger of Onchestus green,",
  "Whether a drove of kine has passed this way,",
  "All heifers with crooked horns? for they have been",
  "Stolen from the herd in high Pieria,",
  "Where a black bull was fed apart, between",
  "Two woody mountains in a neighbouring glen,",
  "And four fierce dogs watched there, unanimous as men.",
  "",
  "'And what is strange, the author of this theft",
  "Has stolen the fatted heifers every one,",
  "But the four dogs and the black bull are left:--",
  "Stolen they were last night at set of sun,",
  "Of their soft beds and their sweet food bereft.--",
  "Now tell me, man born ere the world begun,",
  "Have you seen any one pass with the cows?'--",
  "To whom the man of overhanging brows:",
  "",
  "'My friend, it would require no common skill",
  "Justly to speak of everything I see:",
  "On various purposes of good or ill",
  "Many pass by my vineyard,--and to me",
  "'Tis difficult to know the invisible",
  "Thoughts, which in all those many minds may be:--",
  "Thus much alone I certainly can say,",
  "I tilled these vines till the decline of day,",
  "",
  "'And then I thought I saw, but dare not speak",
  "With certainty of such a wondrous thing,",
  "A child, who could not have been born a week,",
  "Those fair-horned cattle closely following,",
  "And in his hand he held a polished stick:",
  "And, as on purpose, he walked wavering",
  "From one side to the other of the road,",
  "And with his face opposed the steps he trod.'",
  "",
  "Apollo hearing this, passed quickly on--",
  "No winged omen could have shown more clear",
  "That the deceiver was his father's son.",
  "So the God wraps a purple atmosphere",
  "Around his shoulders, and like fire is gone",
  "To famous Pylos, seeking his kine there,",
  "And found their track and his, yet hardly cold,",
  "And cried--'What wonder do mine eyes behold!",
  "",
  "'Here are the footsteps of the horned herd",
  "Turned back towards their fields of asphodel;--",
  "But THESE are not the tracks of beast or bird,",
  "Gray wolf, or bear, or lion of the dell,",
  "Or maned Centaur--sand was never stirred",
  "By man or woman thus! Inexplicable!",
  "Who with unwearied feet could e'er impress",
  "The sand with such enormous vestiges?",
  "",
  "'That was most strange--but this is stranger still!'",
  "Thus having said, Phoebus impetuously",
  "Sought high Cyllene's forest-cinctured hill,",
  "And the deep cavern where dark shadows lie,",
  "And where the ambrosial nymph with happy will",
  "Bore the Saturnian's love-child, Mercury--",
  "And a delightful odour from the dew",
  "Of the hill pastures, at his coming, flew.",
  "",
  "And Phoebus stooped under the craggy roof",
  "Arched over the dark cavern:--Maia's child",
  "Perceived that he came angry, far aloof,",
  "About the cows of which he had been beguiled;",
  "And over him the fine and fragrant woof",
  "Of his ambrosial swaddling-clothes he piled--",
  "As among fire-brands lies a burning spark",
  "Covered, beneath the ashes cold and dark.",
  "",
  "There, like an infant who had sucked his fill",
  "And now was newly washed and put to bed,",
  "Awake, but courting sleep with weary will,",
  "And gathered in a lump, hands, feet, and head,",
  "He lay, and his beloved tortoise still",
  "He grasped and held under his shoulder-blade.",
  "Phoebus the lovely mountain-goddess knew,",
  "Not less her subtle, swindling baby, who",
  "",
  "Lay swathed in his sly wiles. Round every crook",
  "Of the ample cavern, for his kine, Apollo",
  "Looked sharp; and when he saw them not, he took",
  "The glittering key, and opened three great hollow",
  "Recesses in the rock--where many a nook",
  "Was filled with the sweet food immortals swallow,",
  "And mighty heaps of silver and of gold",
  "Were piled within--a wonder to behold!",
  "",
  "And white and silver robes, all overwrought",
  "With cunning workmanship of tracery sweet--",
  "Except among the Gods there can be nought",
  "In the wide world to be compared with it.",
  "Latona's offspring, after having sought",
  "His herds in every corner, thus did greet",
  "Great Hermes:--'Little cradled rogue, declare",
  "Of my illustrious heifers, where they are!",
  "",
  "'Speak quickly! or a quarrel between us",
  "Must rise, and the event will be, that I",
  "Shall hurl you into dismal Tartarus,",
  "In fiery gloom to dwell eternally;",
  "Nor shall your father nor your mother loose",
  "The bars of that black dungeon--utterly",
  "You shall be cast out from the light of day,",
  "To rule the ghosts of men, unblessed as they.",
  "",
  "To whom thus Hermes slily answered:--'Son",
  "Of great Latona, what a speech is this!",
  "Why come you here to ask me what is done",
  "With the wild oxen which it seems you miss?",
  "I have not seen them, nor from any one",
  "Have heard a word of the whole business;",
  "If you should promise an immense reward,",
  "I could not tell more than you now have heard.",
  "",
  "'An ox-stealer should be both tall and strong,",
  "And I am but a little new-born thing,",
  "Who, yet at least, can think of nothing wrong:--",
  "My business is to suck, and sleep, and fling",
  "The cradle-clothes about me all day long,--",
  "Or half asleep, hear my sweet mother sing,",
  "And to be washed in water clean and warm,",
  "And hushed and kissed and kept secure from harm.",
  "",
  "'O, let not e'er this quarrel be averred!",
  "The astounded Gods would laugh at you, if e'er",
  "You should allege a story so absurd",
  "As that a new-born infant forth could fare",
  "Out of his home after a savage herd.",
  "I was born yesterday--my small feet are",
  "Too tender for the roads so hard and rough:--",
  "And if you think that this is not enough,",
  "",
  "I swear a great oath, by my father's head,",
  "That I stole not your cows, and that I know",
  "Of no one else, who might, or could, or did.--",
  "Whatever things cows are, I do not know,",
  "For I have only heard the name.'--This said",
  "He winked as fast as could be, and his brow",
  "Was wrinkled, and a whistle loud gave he,",
  "Like one who hears some strange absurdity.",
  "",
  "Apollo gently smiled and said:--'Ay, ay,--",
  "You cunning little rascal, you will bore",
  "Many a rich man's house, and your array",
  "Of thieves will lay their siege before his door,",
  "Silent as night, in night; and many a day",
  "In the wild glens rough shepherds will deplore",
  "That you or yours, having an appetite,",
  "Met with their cattle, comrade of the night!",
  "",
  "'And this among the Gods shall be your gift,",
  "To be considered as the lord of those",
  "Who swindle, house-break, sheep-steal, and shop-lift;--",
  "But now if you would not your last sleep doze;",
  "Crawl out!'--Thus saying, Phoebus did uplift",
  "The subtle infant in his swaddling clothes,",
  "And in his arms, according to his wont,",
  "A scheme devised the illustrious Argiphont.",
  "",
  "...",
  "...",
  "And sneezed and shuddered--Phoebus on the grass",
  "Him threw, and whilst all that he had designed",
  "He did perform--eager although to pass,",
  "Apollo darted from his mighty mind",
  "Towards the subtle babe the following scoff:--",
  "'Do not imagine this will get you off,",
  "",
  "'You little swaddled child of Jove and May!",
  "And seized him:--'By this omen I shall trace",
  "My noble herds, and you shall lead the way.'--",
  "Cyllenian Hermes from the grassy place,",
  "Like one in earnest haste to get away,",
  "Rose, and with hands lifted towards his face",
  "Round both his ears up from his shoulders drew",
  "His swaddling clothes, and--'What mean you to do",
  "",
  "'With me, you unkind God?'--said Mercury:",
  "'Is it about these cows you tease me so?",

  "I should have ever heard the name of one--",
  "But I appeal to the Saturnian's throne.'",
  "",
  "Thus Phoebus and the vagrant Mercury",
  "Talked without coming to an explanation,",
  "With adverse purpose. As for Phoebus, he",
  "Sought not revenge, but only information,",
  "And Hermes tried with lies and roguery",
  "To cheat Apollo.--But when no evasion",
  "Served--for the cunning one his match had found--",
  "He paced on first over the sandy ground.",
  "",
  "...",
  "He of the Silver Bow the child of Jove",
  "Followed behind, till to their heavenly Sire",
  "Came both his children, beautiful as Love,",
  "And from his equal balance did require",
  "A judgement in the cause wherein they strove.",
  "O'er odorous Olympus and its snows",
  "A murmuring tumult as they came arose,--",
  "",
  "And from the folded depths of the great Hill,",
  "While Hermes and Apollo reverent stood",
  "Before Jove's throne, the indestructible",
  "Immortals rushed in mighty multitude;",
  "And whilst their seats in order due they fill,",
  "The lofty Thunderer in a careless mood",

  "When you have understood the business,",
  "Say not that I alone am fond of prey.",

  "Or upon earth for knavery or craft:--",
  "Out of the field my cattle yester-even,",
  "By the low shore on which the loud sea laughed,",
  "He right down to the river-ford had driven;",
  "And mere astonishment would make you daft",
  "To see the double kind of footsteps strange",
  "He has impressed wherever he did range.",
  "",
  "'The cattle's track on the black dust, full well",
  "Is evident, as if they went towards",
  "The place from which they came--that asphodel",
  "Meadow, in which I feed my many herds,--",

  "Neither upon his feet nor on his hands;--",
  "",
  "'He must have had some other stranger mode",
  "Of moving on: those vestiges immense,",
  "Far as I traced them on the sandy road,",
  "Seemed like the trail of oak-toppings:--but thence",
  "No mark nor track denoting where they trod",
  "The hard ground gave:--but, working at his fence,",
  "A mortal hedger saw him as he passed",
  "To Pylos, with the cows, in fiery haste.",
  "",
  "'I found that in the dark he quietly",
  "Had sacrificed some cows, and before light",
  "Had thrown the ashes all dispersedly",
  "About the road--then, still as gloomy night,",

  "Of my lost cows, whatever things cows be;",
