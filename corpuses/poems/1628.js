  "To howl more loud, while the snow volley keeps",
  "Incessant batter at the window pane,",

  "The shepherd rambling valleys white and wide",
  "With new sensations his old memory fills,",
  "When hedges left at night, no more descried,",
  "Are turned to one white sweep of curving hills,",
  "And trees turned bushes half their bodies hide.",

  "For deep the grass and bushes lie below,",
  "Where little birds that soon at eve went in",
  "With heads tucked in their wings now pine for day",
  "And little feel boys oer their heads can stray.",
