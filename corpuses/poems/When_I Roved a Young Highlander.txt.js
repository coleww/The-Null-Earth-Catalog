  "When I rov'd a young Highlander o'er the dark heath,",
  "  And climb'd thy steep summit, oh Morven of snow!",
  "To gaze on the torrent that thunder'd beneath,",
  "  Or the mist of the tempest that gather'd below;",
  "Untutor'd by science, a stranger to fear,",
  "  And rude as the rocks, where my infancy grew,",
  "No feeling, save one, to my bosom was dear;",
  "  Need I say, my sweet Mary, 'twas centred in you?",
  "",
  "Yet it could not be Love, for I knew not the name,--",
  "  What passion can dwell in the heart of a child?",
  "But, still, I perceive an emotion the same",
  "  As I felt, when a boy, on the crag-cover'd wild:",
  "One image, alone, on my bosom impress'd,",
  "  I lov'd my bleak regions, nor panted for new;",
  "And few were my wants, for my wishes were bless'd,",
  "  And pure were my thoughts, for my soul was with you.",
  "",
  "I arose with the dawn, with my dog as my guide,",
  "  From mountain to mountain I bounded along;",
  "I breasted the billows of Dee's rushing tide,",
  "  And heard at a distance the Highlander's song:",
  "At eve, on my heath-cover'd couch of repose.",
  "  No dreams, save of Mary, were spread to my view;",
  "And warm to the skies my devotions arose,",
  "  For the first of my prayers was a blessing on you.",
  "",
  "I left my bleak home, and my visions are gone;",
  "  The mountains are vanish'd, my youth is no more;",
  "As the last of my race, I must wither alone,",
  "  And delight but in days, I have witness'd before:",
  "Ah! splendour has rais'd, but embitter'd my lot;",
  "  More dear were the scenes which my infancy knew:",
  "Though my hopes may have fail'd, yet they are not",
  "  forgot,",
  "Though cold is my heart, still it lingers with you.",
  "",
  "When I see some dark hill point its crest to the sky,",
  "  I think of the rocks that o'ershadow Colbleen;",
  "When I see the soft blue of a love-speaking eye,",
  "  I think of those eyes that endear'd the rude scene;",
  "When, haply, some light-waving locks I behold,",
  "  That faintly resemble my Mary's in hue,",
  "I think on the long flowing ringlets of gold,",
  "  The locks that were sacred to beauty, and you.",
  "",
  "Yet the day may arrive, when the mountains once more",
  "  Shall rise to my sight, in their mantles of snow;",
  "But while these soar above me, unchang'd as before,",
  "  Will Mary be there to receive me?--ah, no!",
  "Adieu, then, ye hills, where my childhood was bred!",
  "  Thou sweet flowing Dee, to thy waters adieu!",
  "No home in the forest shall shelter my head,--",
  "  Ah! Mary, what home could be mine, but with you?",
