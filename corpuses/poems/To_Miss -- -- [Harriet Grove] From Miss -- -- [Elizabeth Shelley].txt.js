  "The burden this is of each morning-call song.",
  "So -- is going to -- you say,",
  "I hope that success her great efforts will pay [--]",
  "That  will see her, be dazzled outright,",
  "And declare he can't bear to be out of her sight.",
  "Write flaming epistles with love's pointed dart,",
  "Whose sharp little arrow struck right on his heart,",
  "Scold poor innocent Cupid for mischievous ways,",
  "He knows not how much to laud forth her praise,",
  "That he neither eats, drinks or sleeps for her sake,",
  "And hopes her hard heart some compassion will take,",
  "A refusal would kill him, so desperate his flame,",
  "But he fears, for he knows she is not common game,",
  "Then praises her sense, wit, discernment and grace,",
  "He's not one that's caught by a sly looking face,",
  "Yet that's TOO divine--such a black sparkling eye,",
  "At the bare glance of which near a thousand will die;",
  "Thus runs he on meaning but one word in ten,",
  "More than is meant by most such kind of men,",
  "For they're all alike, take them one with another,",
  "Begging pardon--with the exception of my brother.",
  "Of the drawings you mention much praise I have heard,",
  "Most opinion's the same, with the difference of word,",
  "Some get a good name by the voice of the crowd,",
  "Whilst to poor humble merit small praise is allowed,",

  "How oft when we smile it is checked with a sigh,",
  "When Hope, gay deceiver, in pleasure is dressed,",
  "How oft comes a stroke that may rob us of rest.",
  "When we think ourselves safe, and the goal near at hand,",
  "Like a vessel just landing, we're wrecked near the strand,",
  "And though memory forever the sharp pang must feel,",

  "Oh dear! what sentimental stuff have I written,",
  "Only fit to tear up and play with a kitten.",
  "What sober reflections in the midst of this letter!",
  "Jocularity sure would have suited much better;",
