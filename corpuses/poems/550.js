  "Her heart still dictates, and her hand obeys.",
  "",
  "Relentless walls! whose darksome round contains",
  "Repentant sighs, and voluntary pains:",

  "Ye grots and caverns, shagg'd with horrid thorn!",
  "Shrines! where their vigils pale-eyed virgins keep,",
  "And pitying saints, whose statues learn to weep!",
  "Though cold like you, unmoved and silent grown,",
  "I have not yet forgot myself to stone.",
  "All is not Heaven's while Abelard has part,",
  "Still rebel nature holds out half my heart;",
  "Nor prayers nor fasts its stubborn pulse restrain,",
  "Nor tears for ages taught to flow in vain.",
  "",
  "Soon as thy letters trembling I unclose,",
  "That well-known name awakens all my woes.",
  "Oh, name for ever sad! for ever dear!",
  "Still breathed in sighs, still usher'd with a tear.",

  "No happier task these faded eyes pursue;",
  "To read and weep is all they now can do.",
  "",
  "Then share thy pain, allow that sad relief;",
  "Ah, more than share it, give me all thy grief!",
  "Heaven first taught letters for some wretch's aid,",
  "Some banish'd lover, or some captive maid;",

  "Warm from the soul, and faithful to its fires;",
  "The virgin's wish without her fears impart,",
  "Excuse the blush, and pour out all the heart,",
  "Speed the soft intercourse from soul to soul,",

  "Some emanation of the all-beauteous Mind.",
  "Those smiling eyes, attempering every ray,",
  "Shone sweetly lambent with celestial day.",
  "Guiltless I gazed; Heaven listen'd while you sung;",
  "And truths divine came mended from that tongue.",
  "From lips like those, what precept fail'd to move?",
  "Too soon they taught me 'twas no sin to love:",
  "Back through the paths of pleasing sense I ran,",
  "Nor wish'd an angel whom I loved a man.",
  "Dim and remote the joys of saints I see;",
  "Nor envy them that heaven I lose for thee.",
  "",
  "How oft, when press'd to marriage, have I said,",
  "Curse on all laws but those which Love has made!",
  "Love, free as air, at sight of human ties,",

  "Before true passion all those views remove;",
  "Fame, wealth, and honour! what are you to Love?",
  "The jealous god, when we profane his fires,",
  "Those restless passions in revenge inspires,",
  "And bids them make mistaken mortals groan,",

  "More fond than mistress, make me that to thee!",
  "Oh, happy state! when souls each other draw,",
  "When love is liberty, and nature law:",
  "All then is full, possessing and possess'd,",

  "And once the lot of Abelard and me.",
  "",
  "Alas, how changed! what sudden horrors rise!",
  "A naked lover bound and bleeding lies!",

  "Let tears and burning blushes speak the rest.",
  "",
  "Canst thou forget that sad, that solemn day,",
  "When victims at yon altar's foot we lay?",
  "Canst thou forget what tears that moment fell,",
  "When, warm in youth, I bade the world farewell?",
  "As with cold lips I kiss'd the sacred veil,",
  "The shrines all trembled, and the lamps grew pale:",
  "Heaven scarce believed the conquest it survey'd,",
  "And saints with wonder heard the vows I made.",
  "Yet then, to those dread altars as I drew,",
  "Not on the cross my eyes were fix'd, but you:",
  "Not grace, or zeal, love only was my call,",
  "And if I lose thy love, I lose my all.",
  "Come! with thy looks, thy words, relieve my woe;",
  "Those still at least are left thee to bestow.",
  "Still on that breast enamour'd let me lie,",
  "Still drink delicious poison from thy eye,",
  "Pant on thy lip, and to thy heart be press'd;",
  "Give all thou canst--and let me dream the rest.",
  "Ah, no! instruct me other joys to prize,",
  "With other beauties charm my partial eyes,",

  "From the false world in early youth they fled,",
  "By thee to mountains, wilds, and deserts led.",
  "You raised these hallow'd walls; the desert smiled,",
  "And Paradise was open'd in the wild.",
  "No weeping orphan saw his father's stores",
  "Our shrines irradiate, or emblaze the floors;",
  "No silver saints, by dying misers given,",
  "Here bribed the rage of ill-requited Heaven:",
  "But such plain roofs as Piety could raise,",
  "And only vocal with the Maker's praise.",
  "In these lone walls, (their day's eternal bound)",
  "These moss-grown domes with spiry turrets crown'd,",
  "Where awful arches make a noonday night,",
  "And the dim windows shed a solemn light;",
  "Thy eyes diffused a reconciling ray,",
  "And gleams of glory brighten'd all the day.",
  "But now no face divine contentment wears,",
  "'Tis all blank sadness, or continual tears.",
  "See how the force of others' prayers I try,",
  "(Oh pious fraud of amorous charity!)",
  "But why should I on others' prayers depend?",
  "Come thou, my father, brother, husband, friend!",

  "And all those tender names in one--thy love!",
  "The darksome pines that, o'er yon rocks reclined,",
  "Wave high, and murmur to the hollow wind,",
  "The wandering streams that shine between the hills,",
  "The grots that echo to the tinkling rills,",
  "The dying gales that pant upon the trees,",
  "The lakes that quiver to the curling breeze;",

  "A death-like silence, and a dread repose:",
  "Her gloomy presence saddens all the scene,",
  "Shades every flower, and darkens every green,",
  "Deepens the murmur of the falling floods,",
  "And breathes a browner horror on the woods.",
  "",
  "Yet here for ever, ever must I stay;",
  "Sad proof how well a lover can obey!",
  "Death, only death, can break the lasting chain;",
  "And here, even then, shall my cold dust remain;",

  "Ah, wretch! believed the spouse of God in vain,",
  "Confess'd within the slave of love and man.",
  "Assist me, Heaven! but whence arose that prayer?",
  "Sprung it from piety, or from despair?",
  "Even here, where frozen chastity retires,",
  "Love finds an altar for forbidden fires.",
  "I ought to grieve, but cannot what I ought;",
  "I mourn the lover, not lament the fault;",
  "I view my crime, but kindle at the view,",
  "Repent old pleasures, and solicit new;",

  "How the dear object from the crime remove,",
  "Or how distinguish penitence from love?",
  "Unequal task! a passion to resign,",
  "For hearts so touch'd, so pierced, so lost as mine.",
  "Ere such a soul regains its peaceful state,",
  "How often must it love, how often hate!",
  "How often hope, despair, resent, regret,",
  "Conceal, disdain,--do all things but forget!",
  "But let Heaven seize it, all at once 'tis fired;",
  "Not touch'd, but rapt; not waken'd, but inspired!",
  "Oh come! oh teach me nature to subdue,",

  "And wings of seraphs shed divine perfumes;",
  "For her the spouse prepares the bridal ring,",
  "For her white virgins hymeneals sing,",
  "To sounds of heavenly harps she dies away,",
  "And melts in visions of eternal day.",
  "",
  "Far other dreams my erring soul employ,",
  "Far other raptures, of unholy joy:",
  "When at the close of each sad, sorrowing day,",
  "Fancy restores what vengeance snatch'd away,",
  "Then conscience sleeps, and leaving nature free,",
  "All my loose soul unbounded springs to thee.",
  "O curst, dear horrors of all-conscious night!",
  "How glowing guilt exalts the keen delight!",
  "Provoking demons all restraint remove,",
  "And stir within me every source of love.",

  "To dream once more I close my willing eyes;",
  "Ye soft illusions, dear deceits, arise!",
  "Alas, no more! methinks we wandering go",
  "Through dreary wastes, and weep each other's woe,",
  "Where round some mouldering tower pale ivy creeps,",
  "And low-brow'd rocks hang nodding o'er the deeps.",
  "Sudden you mount, you beckon from the skies;",
  "Clouds interpose, waves roar, and winds arise.",
  "I shriek, start up, the same sad prospect find,",
  "And wake to all the griefs I left behind.",
  "",
  "For thee the Fates, severely kind, ordain",
  "A cool suspense from pleasure and from pain;",
  "Thy life a long dead calm of fix'd repose;",
