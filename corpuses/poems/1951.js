  "Where the broad sheepwalk bare and brown",
  "  [Yields] scant grass pining after showers,",
  "And winds go fanning up and down",
  "  The little strawy bents and nodding flowers,",
  "There the huge thistle, spurred with many thorns,",
  "The suncrackt upland's russet swells adorns.",
  "",
  "Not undevoid of beauty there they come,",
  "  Armed warriors, waiting neither suns nor showers,",
  "Guarding the little clover plots to bloom",
  "  While sheep nor oxen dare not crop their flowers",
  "Unsheathing their own knobs of tawny flowers",
  "When summer cometh in her hottest hours.",
  "",
  "The pewit, swopping up and down",
  "  And screaming round the passer bye,",
  "Or running oer the herbage brown",
  "  With copple crown uplifted high,",
  "Loves in its clumps to make a home",
  "Where danger seldom cares to come.",
  "",
  "The yellowhammer, often prest",
  "  For spot to build and be unseen,",
  "Will in its shelter trust her nest",
  "  When fields and meadows glow with green;",
  "And larks, though paths go closely bye,",
  "Will in its shade securely lie.",
  "",
  "The partridge too, that scarce can trust",
  "  The open downs to be at rest,",
  "Will in its clumps lie down, and dust",
  "  And prune its horseshoe-circled breast,",
  "And oft in shining fields of green",
  "Will lay and raise its brood unseen.",
  "",
  "The sheep when hunger presses sore",
  "  May nip the clover round its nest;",
  "But soon the thistle wounding sore",
  "  Relieves it from each brushing guest,",
  "That leaves a bit of wool behind,",
  "The yellowhammer loves to find.",
  "",
  "The horse will set his foot and bite",
  "  Close to the ground lark's guarded nest",
  "And snort to meet the prickly sight;",
  "  He fans the feathers of her breast--",
  "Yet thistles prick so deep that he",
  "Turns back and leaves her dwelling free.",
  "",
  "Its prickly knobs the dews of morn",
  "  Doth bead with dressing rich to see,",
  "When threads doth hang from thorn to thorn",
  "  Like the small spinner's tapestry;",
  "And from the flowers a sultry smell",
  "Comes that agrees with summer well.",
  "",
  "The bee will make its bloom a bed,",
  "  The humble bee in tawny brown;",
  "And one in jacket fringed with red",
  "  Will rest upon its velvet down",
  "When overtaken in the rain,",
  "And wait till sunshine comes again.",
  "",
  "And there are times when travel goes",
  "  Along the sheep tracks' beaten ways,",
  "Then pleasure many a praise bestows",
  "  Upon its blossoms' pointed rays,",
  "When other things are parched beside",
  "And hot day leaves it in its pride.",
