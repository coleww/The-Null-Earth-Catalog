  "The fir trees taper into twigs and wear",
  "The rich blue green of summer all the year,",
  "Softening the roughest tempest almost calm",
  "And offering shelter ever still and warm",
  "To the small path that towels underneath,",
  "Where loudest winds--almost as summer's breath--",
  "Scarce fan the weed that lingers green below",
  "When others out of doors are lost in frost and snow.",
  "And sweet the music trembles on the ear",
  "As the wind suthers through each tiny spear,",
  "Makeshifts for leaves; and yet, so rich they show,",
  "Winter is almost summer where they grow.",
