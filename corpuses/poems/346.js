  "Noiseless as mists and vapors,",
  "From their graves in the trenches ascending,",
  "From the cemeteries all through Virginia and Tennessee,",
  "From every point of the compass, out of the countless unnamed graves,",
  "In wafted clouds, in myraids large, or squads of twos or threes, or single ones, they",
  "    come,",
  "And silently gather round me.",

  "Now sound no note, O trumpeters!",
  "Not at the head of my cavalry, parading on spirited horses,",
  "With sabres drawn and glist’ning, and carbines by their thighs—(ah, my brave",
  "  horsemen!",
  "My handsome, tan-faced horsemen! what life, what joy and pride,",
  "With all the perils, were yours!)",
  "",
  "Nor you drummers—neither at reveille, at dawn,",
  "Nor the long roll alarming the camp—nor even the muffled beat for a burial;",

  "But sweet, ah sweet, are the dead, with their silent eyes.",
  "",
  "Dearest comrades! all is over and long gone;",
  "But love is not over—and what love, O comrades!",
  "Perfume from battle-fields rising—up from foetor arising.",

  "Perfume therefore my chant, O love! immortal Love!",

  "Give me exhaustless—make me a fountain,",
  "That I exhale love from me wherever I go, like a moist perennial dew,",
