  "",
  "\"The fight began, and to me they drew nigh;",

  "Sudden threw up his sword to his left hand,",
  "Caught it, and swung it; that was all the fight,",
  "",
  "\"Except a spout of blood on the hot land;",
  "For it was hottest summer; and I know",

  "",
  "\"And burn, against the heat, would quiver so,",
  "Yards above my head; thus these matters went;",
  "Which things were only warnings of the woe",
  "",
  "\"That fell on me. Yet Mellyagraunce was shent,",

  "\"With all this wickedness; say no rash word",
  "Against me, being so beautiful; my eyes,",
  "Wept all away to grey, may bring some sword",
  "",
  "\"To drown you in your blood; see my breast rise,",
  "Like waves of purple sea, as here I stand;",
  "And how my arms are moved in wonderful wise,",
  "",
  "\"Yea also at my full heart's strong command,",
  "See through my long throat how the words go up",
  "In ripples to my mouth; how in my hand",
  "",
  "\"The shadow lies like wine within a cup",
  "Of marvellously colour'd gold; yea now",
  "This little wind is rising, look you up,",
  "",
  "\"And wonder how the light is falling so",
  "Within my moving tresses: will you dare",
