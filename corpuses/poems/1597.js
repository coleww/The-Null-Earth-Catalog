  "Said Abner, \"At last thou art come! Ere I tell, ere thou speak.",
  "Kiss my cheek, wish me well!\" Then I wished it, and did kiss his cheek.",
  "And he, \"Since the King, O my friend, for thy countenance sent,",
  "Neither drunken nor eaten have we; nor until from his tent",
  "Thou return with the joyful assurance the King liveth yet,",
  "Shall our lip with the honey be bright, with the water be wet.",
  "For out of the black mid-tent's silence, a space of three days,",
  "Not a sound hath escaped to thy servants, of prayer nor of praise,",
  "To betoken that Saul and the Spirit have ended their strife,",
  "And that, faint in his triumph, the monarch sinks back upon life.",
  "",
  "\"Yet now my heart leaps, O beloved! God's child with his dew",
  "On thy gracious gold hair, and those lilies still living and blue",
  "Just broken to twine round thy harp-strings, as if no wild heat",
  "Were now raging to torture the desert!\"",
  "",
  "                                Then I, as was meet,",
  "Knelt down to the God of my fathers, and rose on my feet,",
  "And ran o'er the sand burnt to powder. The tent was unlooped;",
  "I pulled up the spear that obstructed, and under I stooped;",
  "Hands and knees on the slippery grass-patch, all withered and gone,",
  "That extends to the second enclosure. I groped my way on",
  "Till I felt where the foldskirts fly open. Then once more I prayed,",
  "And opened the foldskirts and entered, and was not afraid",
  "But spoke, \"Here is David, thy servant!\" And no voice replied.",
  "At the first I saw naught but the blackness; but soon I descried",
  "A something more black than the blackness--the vast, the upright",
  "Main prop which sustains the pavilion: and slow into sight",
  "Grew a figure against it, gigantic and blackest of all.",
  "Then a sunbeam, that burst thro' the tent roof, showed Saul.",
  "",
  "He stood erect as that tent-prop, both arms stretched out wide",
  "On the great cross-support in the centre, that goes to each side;",
  "He relaxed not a muscle, but hung there as, caught in his pangs",
  "And waiting his change, the king serpent all heavily hangs,",
  "Far away from his kind, in the pine, till deliverance come",
  "With the spring-time,--so agonized Saul, drear and stark, blind and dumb.",
  "",
  "Then I tuned my harp,--took off the lilies we twine round its chords",
  "Lest they snap 'neath the stress of the noontide--those sunbeams like swords!",
  "And I first played the tune all our sheep know, as, one after one,",
  "So docile they come to the pen-door till folding be done.",
  "They are white and untorn by the bushes, for lo, they have fed",
  "Where the long grasses stifle the water within the stream's bed;",
  "And now one after one seeks its lodging, as star follows star",
  "Into eve and the blue far above us,--so, blue and so far!",
  "",
  "--Then the tune, for which quails on the cornland will each leave his mate",
  "To fly after the player; then, what makes the crickets elate",
  "Till for boldness they fight one another: and then, what has weight",
  "To set the quick jerboa a-musing outside his sand house--",
  "There are none such as he for a wonder, half bird and half mouse!",
  "God made all the creatures and gave them our love and our fear,",
  "To give sign, we and they are his children, one family here.",
  "",
  "Then I played the help-tune of our reapers, their wine-song, when hand",
  "Grasps at hand, eye lights eye in good friendship, and great hearts expand",
  "And grow one in the sense of this world's life.--And then, the last song",
  "When the dead man is praised on his journey--\"Bear, bear him along",
  "With his few faults shut up like dead flowerets!\" Are balm-seeds not here",
  "To console us? The land has none left such as he on the bier.",
  "\"Oh, would we might keep thee, my brother!\"--And then, the glad chaunt",
  "Of the marriage,--first go the young maidens, next, she whom we vaunt",
  "As the beauty, the pride of our dwelling.--And then, the great march",
  "Wherein man runs to man to assist him and buttress an arch",
  "Naught can break; who shall harm them, our friends?--Then, the chorus intoned",
  "As the Levites go up to the altar in glory enthroned.",
  "But I stopped here: for here in the darkness Saul groaned.",
  "",
  "And I paused, held my breath in such silence, and listened apart;",
  "And the tent shook, for mighty Saul shuddered: and sparkles 'gan dart",
  "From the jewels that woke in his turban, at once with a start,",
  "All its lordly male-sapphires, and rubies courageous at heart.",
  "So the head: but the body still moved not, still hung there erect.",
  "And I bent once again to my playing, pursued it unchecked,",
  "As I sang,--",
  "",
  "                \"Oh, our manhood's prime vigor! No spirit feels waste,",
  "Not a muscle is stopped in its playing nor sinew unbraced.",
  "Oh, the wild joys of living! the leaping from rock up to rock,",
  "The strong rending of boughs from the fir-tree, the cool silver shock",
  "Of the plunge in a pool's living water, the hunt of the bear,",
  "And the sultriness showing the lion is couched in his lair.",
  "And the meal, the rich dates yellowed over with gold-dust divine,",
  "And the locust-flesh steeped in the pitcher, the full draught of wine,",
  "And the sleep in the dried river-channel where bulrushes tell",
  "That the water was wont to go warbling so softly and well.",
  "How good is man's life, the mere living! how fit to employ",
  "All the heart and the soul and the senses for ever in joy!",
  "Hast thou loved the white locks of thy father, whose sword thou didst guard",
  "When he trusted thee forth with the armies, for glorious reward?",
  "Didst thou see the thin hands of thy mother, held up as men sung",
  "The low song of the nearly departed, and hear her faint tongue",
  "Joining in while it could to the witness, 'Let one more attest,",
  "I have lived, seen God's hand thro' a lifetime, and all was for best!'",
  "Then they sung thro' their tears in strong triumph, not much, but the rest.",
  "And thy brothers, the help and the contest, the working whence grew",
  "Such result as, from seething grape-bundles, the spirit strained true:",
  "And the friends of thy boyhood--that boyhood of wonder and hope,",
  "Present promise and wealth of the future beyond the eye's scope,--",
  "Till lo, thou art grown to a monarch; a people is thine:",
  "And all gifts which the world offers singly, on one head combine!",
  "On one head, all the beauty and strength, love and rage (like the throe",
  "That, a-work in the rock, helps its labour and lets the gold go),",
  "High ambition and deeds which surpass it, fame crowning them,--all",
  "Brought to blaze on the head of one creature--King Saul!\"",
  "",
  "And lo, with that leap of my spirit,--heart, hand, harp, and voice,",
  "Each lifting Saul's name out of sorrow, each bidding rejoice",
  "Saul's fame in the light it was made for----as when, dare I say,",
  "The Lord's army, in rapture of service, strains thro' its array,",
  "And upsoareth the cherubim-chariot--\"Saul!\" cried I, and stopped,",
  "And waited the thing that should follow. Then Saul, who hung propped",
  "By the tent's cross-support in the centre, was struck by his name.",
  "Have ye seen when Spring's arrowy summons goes right to the aim,",
  "And some mountain, the last to withstand her, that held (he alone,",

  "A year's snow bound about for a breastplate,--leaves grasp of the sheet?",
  "Fold on fold all at once it crowds thunderously down to his feet,",
  "And there fronts you, stark, black, but alive yet, your mountain of old,",
  "With his rents, the successive bequeathings of ages untold:",
  "Yea, each harm got in fighting your battles, each furrow and scar",
  "Of his head thrust 'twixt you and the tempest--all hail, there they are!",
  "--Now again to be softened with verdure, again hold the nest",
  "Of the dove, tempt the goat and its young to the green on his crest",
  "For their food in the ardours of summer. One long shudder thrilled.",
  "All the tent till the very air tingled, then sank and was stilled",
  "At the King's self left standing before me, released and aware.",
  "What was gone, what remained? All to traverse 'twixt hope and despair.",
  "Death was past, life not come; so he waited. Awhile his right hand",
  "Held the brow, helped the eyes left too vacant, forthwith to remand",
  "To their place what new objects should enter: 'twas Saul as before.",
  "I looked up, and dared gaze at those eyes, nor was hurt any more",
  "Than by slow pallid sunsets in autumn, ye watch from the shore,",
  "At their sad level gaze o'er the ocean--a sun's slow decline",
  "Over hills which, resolved in stern silence, o'erlap and entwine",
  "Base with base to knit strength more intensely: so, arm folded arm",
  "O'er the chest whose slow heavings subsided.",
  "",
  "                                        What spell or what charm,",
  "(For, awhile there was trouble within me) what next should I urge",
  "To sustain him where song had restored, him? Song filled to the verge",
  "His cup with the wine of this life, pressing all that it yields",
  "Of mere fruitage, the strength and the beauty: beyond, on what fields",
  "Glean a vintage more potent and perfect to brighten the eye,",
  "And bring blood to the lip, and commend them the cup they put by?",
  "He saith, \"It is good:\" still he drinks not: he lets me praise life,",

  "",
  "                                            Then fancies grew rife",

  "Fed in silence--above, the one eagle wheeled slow as in sleep;",
  "And I lay in my hollow and mused on the world that might lie",
  "'Neath his ken, tho' I saw but the strip 'twixt the hill and the sky:",

  "Of mankind as they live in those fashions I hardly shall know!",
  "Schemes of life, its best rules and right uses, the courage that gains,",
  "And the prudence that keeps what men strive for!\" And now these old trains",
  "Of vague thought came again; I grew surer; so, once more the string",

  "The fan-branches all round; and thou mindest when these too, in turn",
  "Broke a-bloom and the palm-tree seemed perfect: yet more was to learn,",
  "E'en the good that comes in with the palm-fruit. Our dates shall we slight,",

  "Shall decay, nor be known in their place, while the palm-wine shall staunch",
  "Every wound of man's spirit in winter. I pour thee such wine.",
  "Leave the flesh to the fate it was fit for! the spirit be thine!",
  "By the spirit, when age shall o'ercome thee, thou still shalt enjoy",
  "More indeed, than at first when, inconscious, the life of a boy.",
  "Crush that life, and behold its wine running! Each deed thou hast done",
  "Dies, revives, goes to work in the world; until e'en as the sun",
  "Looking down on the earth, tho' clouds spoil him, tho' tempests efface,",
  "Can find nothing his own deed produced not, must everywhere trace",
  "The results of his past summer-prime,--so, each ray of thy will.",
  "Every flash of thy passion and prowess, long over, shall thrill",
  "Thy whole people, the countless, with ardour, till they too give forth",
  "A like cheer to their sons: who in turn, fill the South and the North",

  "A gray mountain of marble heaped four-square, till, built to the skies,",

  "In great characters cut by the scribe,--Such was Saul, so he did;",

  "For not half, they'll affirm, is comprised there! Which fault to amend,",
  "In the grove with his kind grows the cedar, whereon they shall spend",
  "(See, in tablets 'tis level before them) their praise, and record",
  "With the gold of the graver, Saul's story,--the statesman's great word.",
  "Side by side with the poet's sweet comment. The river's a-wave",
  "With smooth paper-reeds grazing each other when prophet-winds rave;",

  "Which can scarce dare believe in what marvels last night I took part,",
  "As this morning I gather the fragments, alone with my sheep,",
  "And still fear lest the terrible glory evanish like sleep!",

  "His black locks to their wonted composure, adjusted the swathes",
  "Of his turban, and see--the huge sweat that his countenance bathes,",
  "He wipes off with the robe; and he girds now his loins as of yore,",
  "And feels slow for the armlets of price, with the clasp set before,",

  "His bent head, and the other hung slack--till I touched on the praise",
  "I foresaw from all men in all time, to the man patient there;",
  "And thus ended, the harp falling forward. Then first I was 'ware",
  "That he sat, as I say, with my head just above his vast knees",
  "Which were thrust out each side around me, like oak roots which please",
  "To encircle a lamb when it slumbers. I looked up to know",
  "If the best I could do had brought solace: he spoke not, but slow",
  "Lifted up the hand slack at his side, till he laid it with care",
  "Soft and grave, but in mild settled will, on my brow: thro' my hair",
  "The large fingers were pushed, and he bent back my head, with kind power--",
  "All my face back, intent to peruse it, as men do a flower.",
  "Thus held he me there with his great eyes that scrutinized mine--",
  "And oh, all my heart how it loved him! but where was the sign?",
  "I yearned--\"Could I help thee, my father, inventing a bliss,",
  "I would add, to that life of the past, both the future and this;",
  "I would give thee new life altogether, as good, ages hence.",
  "As this moment,--had love but the warrant, love's heart to dispense!\"",
  "",
  "Then the truth came upon me. No harp more--no song more! outbroke--",
  "",
  "\"I have gone the whole round of creation: I saw and I spoke;",

  "Do I task any faculty highest, to image success?",
  "I but open my eyes,--and perfection, no more and no less,",
  "In the kind I imagined, full-fronts me, and God is seen God",
  "In the star, in the stone, in the flesh, in the soul and the clod.",
  "And thus looking within and around me, I ever renew",

  "Yet with all this abounding experience, this deity known,",

  "That I doubt His own love can compete with it? Here, the parts shift?",
  "Here, the creature surpass the creator,--the end, what began?",
  "Would I fain in my impotent yearning do all for this man,",
