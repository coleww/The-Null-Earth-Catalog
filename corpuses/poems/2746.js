  "Begone, ye critics, and restrain your spite,",

  "Yet have we oft discover'd in their stead",
  "A swarm of drones that buzz'd about your head.",

  "And ponderous slugs move nimbly through the sky.",

  "And Chaerilus taught Codrus to be dull;",
  "Therefore, dear friend, at my advice give o'er",
  "This needless labour; and contend no more",
  "To prove a _dull succession_ to be true,",
