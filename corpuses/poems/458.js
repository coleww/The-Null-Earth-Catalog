  "My first thought was, he lied in every word,",
  "  That hoary cripple, with malicious eye",
  "  Askance to watch the working of his lie",

  "What else should he be set for, with his staff?",
  "  What, save to waylay with his lies, ensnare",
  "  All travellers who might find him posted there,",

  "Would break, what crutch 'gin write my epitaph",
  "  For pastime in the dusty thoroughfare,",
  "",
  "If at his counsel I should turn aside",
  "  Into that ominous tract which, all agree,",
  "  Hides the Dark Tower. Yet acquiescingly",
  "I did turn as he pointed: neither pride",
  "Nor hope rekindling at the end descried.",
  "  So much as gladness that some end might be.",
  "",
  "For, what with my whole world-wide wandering,",

  "While some discuss if near the other graves",
  "  Be room enough for this, and when a day",
  "  Suits best for carrying the corpse away,",
  "With care about the banners, scarves, and staves:",

  "  He may not shame such tender love and stay.",
  "",
  "Thus, I had so long suffered in this quest,",
  "  Heard failure prophesied so oft, been writ",
  "  So many times among \"The Band\"--to wit,",
  "The knights who to the Dark Tower's search addressed",
  "Their steps--that just to fail as they, seemed best,",
  "  And all the doubt was now--should I be fit?",
  "",
  "So, quiet as despair, I turned from him,",
  "  That hateful cripple, out of his highway",
  "  Into the path he pointed. All the day",
  "Had been a dreary one at best, and dim",
  "Was settling to its close, yet shot one grim",
  "  Red leer to see the plain catch its estray.",
  "",
  "For mark! no sooner was I fairly found",
  "  Pledged to the plain, after a pace or two,",
  "  Than, pausing to throw backward a last view",
  "O'er the safe road, 'twas gone; gray plain all round:",
  "Nothing but plain to the horizon's bound,",

  "No! penury, inertness, and grimace,",
  "  In some strange sort, were the land's portion. \"See",

  "'Tis the Last Judgment's fire must cure this place,",
  "  Calcine its clods and set my prisoners free.\"",
  "",
  "If there pushed any ragged thistle-stalk",
  "  Above its mates, the head was chopped; the bents",
  "  Were jealous else. What made those holes and rents",
  "In the dock's harsh swarth leaves, bruised as to balk",
  "All hope of greenness? 'tis a brute must walk",
  "  Pashing their life out, with a brute's intents.",
  "",
  "As for the grass, it grew as scant as hair",
  "  In leprosy; thin dry blades pricked the mud",
  "  Which underneath looked kneaded up with blood.",
  "One stiff blind horse, his every bone a-stare,",
  "Stood stupefied, however he came there:",
  "  Thrust out past service from the devil's stud!",
  "",
  "Alive? he might be dead for aught I know,",
  "  With that red gaunt and colloped neck a-strain,",
  "  And shut eyes underneath the rusty mane;",
  "Seldom went such grotesqueness with such woe;",
  "I never saw a brute I hated so;",
  "  He must be wicked to deserve such pain.",
  "",
  "I shut my eyes and turned them on my heart.",
  "  As a man calls for wine before he fights,",

  "",
  "Not it! I fancied Cuthbert's reddening face",
  "  Beneath its garniture of curly gold,",
  "  Dear fellow, till I almost felt him fold",
  "An arm in mine to fix me to the place,",
  "That way he used. Alas, one night's disgrace!",
  "  Out went my heart's new fire and left it cold.",
  "",
  "Giles then, the soul of honour--there he stands",
  "  Frank as ten years ago when knighted first.",
  "  What honest man should dare (he said) he durst.",
  "Good--but the scene shifts--faugh! what hangman hands",
  "Pin to his breast a parchment? His own bands",
  "  Read it. Poor traitor, spit upon and curst!",
  "",
  "Better this present than a past like that;",
  "  Back therefore to my darkening path again!",
  "  No sound, no sight so far as eye could strain.",
  "Will the night send a howlet or a bat?",
  "I asked: when something on the dismal flat",
  "  Came to arrest my thoughts and change their train.",
  "",
  "A sudden little river crossed my path",
  "  As unexpected as a serpent comes.",
  "  No sluggish tide congenial to the glooms;",
  "This, as it frothed by, might have been a bath",
  "For the fiend's glowing hoof--to see the wrath",
  "  Of its black eddy bespate with flakes and spumes.",
  "",
  "So petty, yet so spiteful! All along,",
  "  Low scrubby alders kneeled down over it;",
  "  Drenched willows flung them headlong in a fit",

  "",
  "Which, while I forded,--good saints, how I feared",
  "  To set my foot upon a dead man's cheek,",
  "  Each step, or feel the spear I thrust to seek",
  "For hollows, tangled in his hair or beard!",
  "--It may have been a water-rat I speared,",
  "  But, ugh! it sounded like a baby's shriek.",
  "",
  "Glad was I when I reached the other bank.",
  "  Now for a better country. Vain presage!",
  "  Who were the strugglers, what war did they wage",
  "Whose savage trample thus could pad the dank",
  "Soil to a plash? Toads in a poisoned tank,",
  "  Or wild cats in a red-hot iron cage--",
  "",
  "The fight must so have seemed in that fell cirque.",
  "  What penned them there, with all the plain, to choose?",
  "  No foot-print leading to that horrid mews,",
  "None out of it. Mad brewage set to work",
  "Their brains, no doubt, like galley-slaves the Turk",
  "  Pits for his pastime, Christians against Jews.",
  "",
  "And more than that--a furlong on--why, there!",
  "  What bad use was that engine for, that wheel,",
  "  Or brake, not wheel--that harrow fit to reel",
  "Men's bodies out like silk? with all the air",
  "Of Tophet's tool, on earth left unaware,",
  "  Or brought to sharpen its rusty teeth of steel.",
  "",
  "Then came a bit of stubbed ground, once a wood,",
  "  Next a marsh, it would seem, and now mere earth",
  "  Desperate and done with; (so a fool finds mirth,",
  "Makes a thing and then mars it, till his mood",
  "Changes, and off he goes!) within a rood--",
  "  Bog, clay, and rubble, sand, and stark black dearth.",
  "",
  "Now blotches rankling, coloured gay and grim,",
  "  Now patches where some leanness of the soil's",
  "  Broke into moss or substances like boils;",
  "Then came some palsied oak, a cleft in him",
  "Like a distorted mouth that splits its rim",
  "  Gaping at death, and dies while it recoils.",
  "",
  "And just as far as ever from the end,",
  "  Naught in the distance but the evening, naught",
  "  To point my footstep further! At the thought,",
  "A great black bird, Apollyon's bosom-friend,",
  "Sailed past, nor beat his wide wing dragon-penned",
  "  That brushed my cap--perchance the guide I sought.",
  "",
  "For, looking up, aware I somehow grew,",
  "  'Spite of the dusk, the plain had given place",
  "  All round to mountains--with such name to grace",
  "Mere ugly heights and heaps now stolen in view.",
  "How thus they had surprised me,--solve it, you!",
  "  How to get from them was no clearer case.",
  "",
  "Yet half I seemed to recognize some trick",
  "  Of mischief happened to me, Gods knows when--",
  "  In a bad dream, perhaps. Here ended, then,",
  "Progress this way. When, in the very nick",
  "Of giving up, one time more, came a click",
  "  As when a trap shuts--you're inside the den.",
  "",
  "Burningly it came on me all at once,",
  "  This was the place! those two hills on the right,",
  "  Crouched like two bulls locked horn in horn in fight;",
  "While, to the left, a tall scalped mountain ... Dunce,",
  "Dotard, a-dozing at the very nonce,",
  "  After a life spent training for the sight!",
  "",
  "What in the midst lay but the Tower itself?",
  "  The round squat turret, blind as the fool's heart,",
  "  Built of brown stone, without a counterpart",
  "In the whole world. The tempest's mocking elf",
  "Points to the shipman thus the unseen shelf",
  "  He strikes on, only when the timbers start.",
  "",
  "Not see? because of night perhaps?--why, day",
  "  Came back again for that! before it left,",
  "  The dying sunset kindled thro' a cleft:",
  "The hills, like giants at a hunting, lay,",
  "Chin upon hand, to see the game at bay,",
  "  \"Now stab and end the creature--to the heft!\"",
  "",
  "Not hear? when noise was everywhere! it tolled",
  "  Increasing like a bell. Names in my ears,",
  "  Of all the lost adventurers my peers,--",
  "How such a one was strong, and such was bold,",
  "And such was fortunate, yet each of old",
  "  Lost, lost! one moment knelled the woe of years.",
  "",
  "There they stood, ranged along the hillsides, met",
  "  To view the last of me, a living frame",
  "  For one more picture! in a sheet of flame",
  "I saw them and I knew them all. And yet",
  "Dauntless the slug-horn to my lips I set,",
  "  And blew. \"_Childe Roland to the Dark Tower came._\"",
