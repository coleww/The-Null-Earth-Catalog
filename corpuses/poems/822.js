  "Queen Guinevere had fled the court, and sat",
  "There in the holy house at Almesbury",
  "Weeping, none with her save a little maid,",
  "A novice: one low light betwixt them burned",
  "Blurred by the creeping mist, for all abroad,",
  "Beneath a moon unseen albeit at full,",
  "The white mist, like a face-cloth to the face,",
  "Clung to the dead earth, and the land was still.",
  "",
  "For hither had she fled, her cause of flight",
  "Sir Modred; he that like a subtle beast",
  "Lay couchant with his eyes upon the throne,",
  "Ready to spring, waiting a chance: for this",
  "He chilled the popular praises of the King",
  "With silent smiles of slow disparagement;",
  "And tampered with the Lords of the White Horse,",
  "Heathen, the brood by Hengist left; and sought",
  "To make disruption in the Table Round",
  "Of Arthur, and to splinter it into feuds",
  "Serving his traitorous end; and all his aims",
  "Were sharpened by strong hate for Lancelot.",
  "",
  "For thus it chanced one morn when all the court,",
  "Green-suited, but with plumes that mocked the may,",
  "Had been, their wont, a-maying and returned,",
  "That Modred still in green, all ear and eye,",
  "Climbed to the high top of the garden-wall",
  "To spy some secret scandal if he might,",
  "And saw the Queen who sat betwixt her best",
  "Enid, and lissome Vivien, of her court",
  "The wiliest and the worst; and more than this",
  "He saw not, for Sir Lancelot passing by",
  "Spied where he couched, and as the gardener's hand",
  "Picks from the colewort a green caterpillar,",
  "So from the high wall and the flowering grove",
  "Of grasses Lancelot plucked him by the heel,",
  "And cast him as a worm upon the way;",
  "But when he knew the Prince though marred with dust,",
  "He, reverencing king's blood in a bad man,",
  "Made such excuses as he might, and these",
  "Full knightly without scorn; for in those days",
  "No knight of Arthur's noblest dealt in scorn;",
  "But, if a man were halt or hunched, in him",
  "By those whom God had made full-limbed and tall,",
  "Scorn was allowed as part of his defect,",
  "And he was answered softly by the King",
  "And all his Table. So Sir Lancelot holp",
  "To raise the Prince, who rising twice or thrice",
  "Full sharply smote his knees, and smiled, and went:",
  "But, ever after, the small violence done",
  "Rankled in him and ruffled all his heart,",
  "As the sharp wind that ruffles all day long",
  "A little bitter pool about a stone",
  "On the bare coast.",
  "",
  "But when Sir Lancelot told",
  "This matter to the Queen, at first she laughed",
  "Lightly, to think of Modred's dusty fall,",
  "Then shuddered, as the village wife who cries",
  "`I shudder, some one steps across my grave;'",
  "Then laughed again, but faintlier, for indeed",
  "She half-foresaw that he, the subtle beast,",
  "Would track her guilt until he found, and hers",
  "Would be for evermore a name of scorn.",
  "Henceforward rarely could she front in hall,",
  "Or elsewhere, Modred's narrow foxy face,",
  "Heart-hiding smile, and gray persistent eye:",
  "Henceforward too, the Powers that tend the soul,",
  "To help it from the death that cannot die,",
  "And save it even in extremes, began",
  "To vex and plague her. Many a time for hours,",
  "Beside the placid breathings of the King,",
  "In the dead night, grim faces came and went",
  "Before her, or a vague spiritual fear--",
  "Like to some doubtful noise of creaking doors,",
  "Heard by the watcher in a haunted house,",
  "That keeps the rust of murder on the walls--",
  "Held her awake: or if she slept, she dreamed",
  "An awful dream; for then she seemed to stand",
  "On some vast plain before a setting sun,",
  "And from the sun there swiftly made at her",
  "A ghastly something, and its shadow flew",
  "Before it, till it touched her, and she turned--",
  "When lo! her own, that broadening from her feet,",
  "And blackening, swallowed all the land, and in it",
  "Far cities burnt, and with a cry she woke.",
  "And all this trouble did not pass but grew;",
  "Till even the clear face of the guileless King,",
  "And trustful courtesies of household life,",
  "Became her bane; and at the last she said,",
  "`O Lancelot, get thee hence to thine own land,",
  "For if thou tarry we shall meet again,",
  "And if we meet again, some evil chance",
  "Will make the smouldering scandal break and blaze",
  "Before the people, and our lord the King.'",
  "And Lancelot ever promised, but remained,",
  "And still they met and met. Again she said,",
  "`O Lancelot, if thou love me get thee hence.'",
  "And then they were agreed upon a night",
  "(When the good King should not be there) to meet",
  "And part for ever. Vivien, lurking, heard.",
  "She told Sir Modred. Passion-pale they met",
  "And greeted. Hands in hands, and eye to eye,",
  "Low on the border of her couch they sat",
  "Stammering and staring. It was their last hour,",
  "A madness of farewells. And Modred brought",
  "His creatures to the basement of the tower",
  "For testimony; and crying with full voice",
  "`Traitor, come out, ye are trapt at last,' aroused",
  "Lancelot, who rushing outward lionlike",
  "Leapt on him, and hurled him headlong, and he fell",
  "Stunned, and his creatures took and bare him off,",
  "And all was still: then she, `The end is come,",
  "And I am shamed for ever;' and he said,",
  "`Mine be the shame; mine was the sin: but rise,",
  "And fly to my strong castle overseas:",
  "There will I hide thee, till my life shall end,",
  "There hold thee with my life against the world.'",
  "She answered, `Lancelot, wilt thou hold me so?",
  "Nay, friend, for we have taken our farewells.",
  "Would God that thou couldst hide me from myself!",
  "Mine is the shame, for I was wife, and thou",
  "Unwedded: yet rise now, and let us fly,",
  "For I will draw me into sanctuary,",
  "And bide my doom.' So Lancelot got her horse,",
  "Set her thereon, and mounted on his own,",
  "And then they rode to the divided way,",
  "There kissed, and parted weeping: for he past,",
  "Love-loyal to the least wish of the Queen,",
  "Back to his land; but she to Almesbury",
  "Fled all night long by glimmering waste and weald,",
  "And heard the Spirits of the waste and weald",
  "Moan as she fled, or thought she heard them moan:",
  "And in herself she moaned `Too late, too late!'",
  "Till in the cold wind that foreruns the morn,",
  "A blot in heaven, the Raven, flying high,",
  "Croaked, and she thought, `He spies a field of death;",
  "For now the Heathen of the Northern Sea,",
  "Lured by the crimes and frailties of the court,",
  "Begin to slay the folk, and spoil the land.'",
  "",
  "And when she came to Almesbury she spake",
  "There to the nuns, and said, `Mine enemies",
  "Pursue me, but, O peaceful Sisterhood,",
  "Receive, and yield me sanctuary, nor ask",
  "Her name to whom ye yield it, till her time",
  "To tell you:' and her beauty, grace and power,",
  "Wrought as a charm upon them, and they spared",
  "To ask it.",
  "",
  "So the stately Queen abode",
  "For many a week, unknown, among the nuns;",
  "Nor with them mixed, nor told her name, nor sought,",
  "Wrapt in her grief, for housel or for shrift,",
  "But communed only with the little maid,",
  "Who pleased her with a babbling heedlessness",
  "Which often lured her from herself; but now,",
  "This night, a rumour wildly blown about",
  "Came, that Sir Modred had usurped the realm,",
  "And leagued him with the heathen, while the King",
  "Was waging war on Lancelot: then she thought,",
  "`With what a hate the people and the King",
  "Must hate me,' and bowed down upon her hands",
  "Silent, until the little maid, who brooked",
  "No silence, brake it, uttering, `Late! so late!",
  "What hour, I wonder, now?' and when she drew",
  "No answer, by and by began to hum",
  "An air the nuns had taught her; `Late, so late!'",
  "Which when she heard, the Queen looked up, and said,",
  "`O maiden, if indeed ye list to sing,",
  "Sing, and unbind my heart that I may weep.'",
  "Whereat full willingly sang the little maid.",
  "",
  "`Late, late, so late! and dark the night and chill!",
  "Late, late, so late! but we can enter still.",
  "Too late, too late! ye cannot enter now.",
  "",
  "`No light had we: for that we do repent;",
  "And learning this, the bridegroom will relent.",
  "Too late, too late! ye cannot enter now.",
  "",
  "`No light: so late! and dark and chill the night!",
  "O let us in, that we may find the light!",
  "Too late, too late: ye cannot enter now.",
  "",
  "`Have we not heard the bridegroom is so sweet?",
  "O let us in, though late, to kiss his feet!",
  "No, no, too late! ye cannot enter now.'",
  "",
  "So sang the novice, while full passionately,",
  "Her head upon her hands, remembering",
  "Her thought when first she came, wept the sad Queen.",
  "Then said the little novice prattling to her,",
  "`O pray you, noble lady, weep no more;",
  "But let my words, the words of one so small,",
  "Who knowing nothing knows but to obey,",
  "And if I do not there is penance given--",
  "Comfort your sorrows; for they do not flow",
  "From evil done; right sure am I of that,",
  "Who see your tender grace and stateliness.",
  "But weigh your sorrows with our lord the King's,",
  "And weighing find them less; for gone is he",
  "To wage grim war against Sir Lancelot there,",
  "Round that strong castle where he holds the Queen;",
  "And Modred whom he left in charge of all,",
  "The traitor--Ah sweet lady, the King's grief",
  "For his own self, and his own Queen, and realm,",
  "Must needs be thrice as great as any of ours.",
  "For me, I thank the saints, I am not great.",
  "For if there ever come a grief to me",
  "I cry my cry in silence, and have done.",
  "None knows it, and my tears have brought me good:",
  "But even were the griefs of little ones",
  "As great as those of great ones, yet this grief",
  "Is added to the griefs the great must bear,",
  "That howsoever much they may desire",
  "Silence, they cannot weep behind a cloud:",
  "As even here they talk at Almesbury",
  "About the good King and his wicked Queen,",
  "And were I such a King with such a Queen,",
  "Well might I wish to veil her wickedness,",
  "But were I such a King, it could not be.'",
  "",
  "Then to her own sad heart muttered the Queen,",
  "`Will the child kill me with her innocent talk?'",
  "But openly she answered, `Must not I,",
  "If this false traitor have displaced his lord,",
  "Grieve with the common grief of all the realm?'",
  "",
  "`Yea,' said the maid, `this is all woman's grief,",
  "That SHE is woman, whose disloyal life",
  "Hath wrought confusion in the Table Round",
  "Which good King Arthur founded, years ago,",
  "With signs and miracles and wonders, there",
  "At Camelot, ere the coming of the Queen.'",
  "",
  "Then thought the Queen within herself again,",
  "`Will the child kill me with her foolish prate?'",
  "But openly she spake and said to her,",
  "`O little maid, shut in by nunnery walls,",
  "What canst thou know of Kings and Tables Round,",
  "Or what of signs and wonders, but the signs",
  "And simple miracles of thy nunnery?'",
  "",
  "To whom the little novice garrulously,",
  "`Yea, but I know: the land was full of signs",
  "And wonders ere the coming of the Queen.",
  "So said my father, and himself was knight",
  "Of the great Table--at the founding of it;",
  "And rode thereto from Lyonnesse, and he said",
  "That as he rode, an hour or maybe twain",
  "After the sunset, down the coast, he heard",
  "Strange music, and he paused, and turning--there,",
  "All down the lonely coast of Lyonnesse,",
  "Each with a beacon-star upon his head,",
  "And with a wild sea-light about his feet,",
  "He saw them--headland after headland flame",
  "Far on into the rich heart of the west:",
  "And in the light the white mermaiden swam,",
  "And strong man-breasted things stood from the sea,",
  "And sent a deep sea-voice through all the land,",
  "To which the little elves of chasm and cleft",
  "Made answer, sounding like a distant horn.",
  "So said my father--yea, and furthermore,",
  "Next morning, while he past the dim-lit woods,",
  "Himself beheld three spirits mad with joy",
  "Come dashing down on a tall wayside flower,",
  "That shook beneath them, as the thistle shakes",
  "When three gray linnets wrangle for the seed:",
  "And still at evenings on before his horse",
  "The flickering fairy-circle wheeled and broke",
  "Flying, and linked again, and wheeled and broke",
  "Flying, for all the land was full of life.",
  "And when at last he came to Camelot,",
  "A wreath of airy dancers hand-in-hand",
  "Swung round the lighted lantern of the hall;",
  "And in the hall itself was such a feast",
  "As never man had dreamed; for every knight",
  "Had whatsoever meat he longed for served",
  "By hands unseen; and even as he said",
  "Down in the cellars merry bloated things",
  "Shouldered the spigot, straddling on the butts",
  "While the wine ran: so glad were spirits and men",
  "Before the coming of the sinful Queen.'",
  "",
  "Then spake the Queen and somewhat bitterly,",
  "`Were they so glad? ill prophets were they all,",
  "Spirits and men: could none of them foresee,",
  "Not even thy wise father with his signs",
  "And wonders, what has fallen upon the realm?'",
  "",
  "To whom the novice garrulously again,",
  "`Yea, one, a bard; of whom my father said,",
  "Full many a noble war-song had he sung,",
  "Even in the presence of an enemy's fleet,",
  "Between the steep cliff and the coming wave;",
  "And many a mystic lay of life and death",
  "Had chanted on the smoky mountain-tops,",
  "When round him bent the spirits of the hills",
  "With all their dewy hair blown back like flame:",
  "So said my father--and that night the bard",
  "Sang Arthur's glorious wars, and sang the King",
  "As wellnigh more than man, and railed at those",
  "Who called him the false son of Gorlos:",
  "For there was no man knew from whence he came;",
  "But after tempest, when the long wave broke",
  "All down the thundering shores of Bude and Bos,",
  "There came a day as still as heaven, and then",
  "They found a naked child upon the sands",
  "Of dark Tintagil by the Cornish sea;",
  "And that was Arthur; and they fostered him",
  "Till he by miracle was approven King:",
  "And that his grave should be a mystery",
  "From all men, like his birth; and could he find",
  "A woman in her womanhood as great",
  "As he was in his manhood, then, he sang,",
  "The twain together well might change the world.",
  "But even in the middle of his song",
  "He faltered, and his hand fell from the harp,",
  "And pale he turned, and reeled, and would have fallen,",
  "But that they stayed him up; nor would he tell",
  "His vision; but what doubt that he foresaw",
  "This evil work of Lancelot and the Queen?'",
  "",
  "Then thought the Queen, `Lo! they have set her on,",
  "Our simple-seeming Abbess and her nuns,",
  "To play upon me,' and bowed her head nor spake.",
  "Whereat the novice crying, with clasped hands,",
  "Shame on her own garrulity garrulously,",
  "Said the good nuns would check her gadding tongue",
  "Full often, `and, sweet lady, if I seem",
  "To vex an ear too sad to listen to me,",
  "Unmannerly, with prattling and the tales",
  "Which my good father told me, check me too",
  "Nor let me shame my father's memory, one",
  "Of noblest manners, though himself would say",
  "Sir Lancelot had the noblest; and he died,",
  "Killed in a tilt, come next, five summers back,",
  "And left me; but of others who remain,",
  "And of the two first-famed for courtesy--",
  "And pray you check me if I ask amiss-",
  "But pray you, which had noblest, while you moved",
  "Among them, Lancelot or our lord the King?'",
  "",
  "Then the pale Queen looked up and answered her,",
  "`Sir Lancelot, as became a noble knight,",
  "Was gracious to all ladies, and the same",
  "In open battle or the tilting-field",
  "Forbore his own advantage, and the King",
  "In open battle or the tilting-field",
  "Forbore his own advantage, and these two",
  "Were the most nobly-mannered men of all;",
  "For manners are not idle, but the fruit",
  "Of loyal nature, and of noble mind.'",
  "",
  "`Yea,' said the maid, `be manners such fair fruit?'",
  "Then Lancelot's needs must be a thousand-fold",
  "Less noble, being, as all rumour runs,",
  "The most disloyal friend in all the world.'",
  "",
  "To which a mournful answer made the Queen:",
  "`O closed about by narrowing nunnery-walls,",
  "What knowest thou of the world, and all its lights",
  "And shadows, all the wealth and all the woe?",
  "If ever Lancelot, that most noble knight,",
  "Were for one hour less noble than himself,",
  "Pray for him that he scape the doom of fire,",
  "And weep for her that drew him to his doom.'",
  "",
  "`Yea,' said the little novice, `I pray for both;",
  "But I should all as soon believe that his,",
  "Sir Lancelot's, were as noble as the King's,",
  "As I could think, sweet lady, yours would be",
  "Such as they are, were you the sinful Queen.'",
  "",
  "So she, like many another babbler, hurt",
  "Whom she would soothe, and harmed where she would heal;",
  "For here a sudden flush of wrathful heat",
  "Fired all the pale face of the Queen, who cried,",
  "`Such as thou art be never maiden more",
  "For ever! thou their tool, set on to plague",
  "And play upon, and harry me, petty spy",
  "And traitress.' When that storm of anger brake",
  "From Guinevere, aghast the maiden rose,",
  "White as her veil, and stood before the Queen",
  "As tremulously as foam upon the beach",
  "Stands in a wind, ready to break and fly,",
  "And when the Queen had added `Get thee hence,'",
  "Fled frighted. Then that other left alone",
  "Sighed, and began to gather heart again,",
  "Saying in herself, `The simple, fearful child",
  "Meant nothing, but my own too-fearful guilt,",
  "Simpler than any child, betrays itself.",
  "But help me, heaven, for surely I repent.",
  "For what is true repentance but in thought--",
  "Not even in inmost thought to think again",
  "The sins that made the past so pleasant to us:",
  "And I have sworn never to see him more,",
  "To see him more.'",
  "",
  "And even in saying this,",
  "Her memory from old habit of the mind",
  "Went slipping back upon the golden days",
  "In which she saw him first, when Lancelot came,",
  "Reputed the best knight and goodliest man,",
  "Ambassador, to lead her to his lord",
  "Arthur, and led her forth, and far ahead",
  "Of his and her retinue moving, they,",
  "Rapt in sweet talk or lively, all on love",
  "And sport and tilts and pleasure, (for the time",
  "Was maytime, and as yet no sin was dreamed,)",
  "Rode under groves that looked a paradise",
  "Of blossom, over sheets of hyacinth",
  "That seemed the heavens upbreaking through the earth,",
  "And on from hill to hill, and every day",
  "Beheld at noon in some delicious dale",
  "The silk pavilions of King Arthur raised",
  "For brief repast or afternoon repose",
  "By couriers gone before; and on again,",
  "Till yet once more ere set of sun they saw",
  "The Dragon of the great Pendragonship,",
  "That crowned the state pavilion of the King,",
  "Blaze by the rushing brook or silent well.",
  "",
  "But when the Queen immersed in such a trance,",
  "And moving through the past unconsciously,",
  "Came to that point where first she saw the King",
  "Ride toward her from the city, sighed to find",
  "Her journey done, glanced at him, thought him cold,",
  "High, self-contained, and passionless, not like him,",
  "`Not like my Lancelot'--while she brooded thus",
  "And grew half-guilty in her thoughts again,",
  "There rode an armd warrior to the doors.",
  "A murmuring whisper through the nunnery ran,",
  "Then on a sudden a cry, `The King.' She sat",
  "Stiff-stricken, listening; but when armd feet",
  "Through the long gallery from the outer doors",
  "Rang coming, prone from off her seat she fell,",
  "And grovelled with her face against the floor:",
  "There with her milkwhite arms and shadowy hair",
  "She made her face a darkness from the King:",
  "And in the darkness heard his armd feet",

  "I cannot take thy hand: that too is flesh,",
  "And in the flesh thou hast sinned; and mine own flesh,",
  "Here looking down on thine polluted, cries",
  "\"I loathe thee:\" yet not less, O Guinevere,",
  "For I was ever virgin save for thee,",
  "My love through flesh hath wrought into my life",
  "So far, that my doom is, I love thee still.",

  "And while she grovelled at his feet,",

  "",
  "Then, listening till those armd steps were gone,",
  "Rose the pale Queen, and in her anguish found",
  "The casement: `peradventure,' so she thought,",
  "`If I might see his face, and not be seen.'",
  "And lo, he sat on horseback at the door!",
  "And near him the sad nuns with each a light",
  "Stood, and he gave them charge about the Queen,",
  "To guard and foster her for evermore.",

  "And grayer, till himself became as mist",
  "Before her, moving ghostlike to his doom.",
  "",
  "Then she stretched out her arms and cried aloud",
  "`Oh Arthur!' there her voice brake suddenly,",
  "Then--as a stream that spouting from a cliff",
  "Fails in mid air, but gathering at the base",
  "Re-makes itself, and flashes down the vale--",
  "Went on in passionate utterance:",
  "",
  "`Gone--my lord!",

  "Farewell? I should have answered his farewell.",
  "His mercy choked me. Gone, my lord the King,",
  "My own true lord! how dare I call him mine?",

  "No, nor by living can I live it down.",

  "Before high God. Ah great and gentle lord,",

  "Among his warring senses, to thy knights--",
  "To whom my false voluptuous pride, that took",
  "Full easily all impressions from below,",

  "Here her hand",
