  "An elegy on the death of MONTGOMERY TAPPEN who dies at Poughkeepsie on the 20th of Nov. 1784 in the ninth year of his age.",
  "",
  "",
  "The sweetest, gentlest, of the youthful train,",
  "Here lies his clay cold upon the sable bier!",
  "He scarce had started on life's varied plain,",
  "For dreary death arrested his career.",
  "",
  "His cheek might vie with the expanded rose,",
  "And Genius sparkled in his azure eyes!",
  "A victim so unblemish'd Heaven chose,",
  "And bore the beauteous lambkin to the skies.",
  "",
  "Adieu thou loveliest child! Adieu adieu!",
  "Our wishes fain would follow thee on high.",
  "What more can friendship - what more fondness do,",
  "But drop the unbidden tear & heave the sigh?",
  "",
  "Ye youths whose ardent bosoms virtue fires,",
  "Who eager wish applause and pant for fame,",
  "Press round MONTGOMERY'S hearse, the NAME inspires",
  "And lights in kindred souls its native flame.",
  "",
  "COLUMBIA grateful hails the tender sound",
  "And when MONTGOMERY'S nam'd still drops a tear,",
  "From shore to shore to earth's remotest bound",
  "Where LIBERTY is known that NAME is dear.",
