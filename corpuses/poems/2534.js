  "A woodman whose rough heart was out of tune",
  "(I think such hearts yet never came to good)",
  "Hated to hear, under the stars or moon,",
  "",
  "One nightingale in an interfluous wood",
  "Satiate the hungry dark with melody;--",
  "And as a vale is watered by a flood,",
  "",
  "Or as the moonlight fills the open sky",
  "Struggling with darkness--as a tuberose",
  "Peoples some Indian dell with scents which lie",
  "",
  "Like clouds above the flower from which they rose,",
  "The singing of that happy nightingale",
  "In this sweet forest, from the golden close",
  "",
  "Of evening till the star of dawn may fail,",
  "Was interfused upon the silentness;",
  "The folded roses and the violets pale",
  "",
  "Heard her within their slumbers, the abyss",
  "Of heaven with all its planets; the dull ear",
  "Of the night-cradled earth; the loneliness",
  "",
  "Of the circumfluous waters,--every sphere",
  "And every flower and beam and cloud and wave,",
  "And every wind of the mute atmosphere,",
  "",
  "And every beast stretched in its rugged cave,",
  "And every bird lulled on its mossy bough,",
  "And every silver moth fresh from the grave",
  "",
  "Which is its cradle--ever from below",
  "Aspiring like one who loves too fair, too far,",
  "To be consumed within the purest glow",
  "",
  "Of one serene and unapproached star,",
  "As if it were a lamp of earthly light,",
  "Unconscious, as some human lovers are,",
  "",
  "Itself how low, how high beyond all height",
  "The heaven where it would perish!--and every form",
  "That worshipped in the temple of the night",
  "",
  "Was awed into delight, and by the charm",
  "Girt as with an interminable zone,",
  "Whilst that sweet bird, whose music was a storm",
  "",
  "Of sound, shook forth the dull oblivion",
  "Out of their dreams; harmony became love",
  "In every soul but one.",
  "",
  "...",
  "",
  "And so this man returned with axe and saw",
  "At evening close from killing the tall treen,",
  "The soul of whom by Nature's gentle law",
  "",
  "Was each a wood-nymph, and kept ever green",
  "The pavement and the roof of the wild copse,",
  "Chequering the sunlight of the blue serene",
  "",
  "With jagged leaves,--and from the forest tops",
  "Singing the winds to sleep--or weeping oft",
  "Fast showers of aereal water-drops",
  "",
  "Into their mother's bosom, sweet and soft,",
  "Nature's pure tears which have no bitterness;--",
  "Around the cradles of the birds aloft",
  "",
  "They spread themselves into the loveliness",
  "Of fan-like leaves, and over pallid flowers",
  "Hang like moist clouds:--or, where high branches kiss,",
  "",
  "Make a green space among the silent bowers,",
  "Like a vast fane in a metropolis,",
  "Surrounded by the columns and the towers",
  "",
  "All overwrought with branch-like traceries",
  "In which there is religion--and the mute",
  "Persuasion of unkindled melodies,",
  "",
  "Odours and gleams and murmurs, which the lute",
  "Of the blind pilot-spirit of the blast",
  "Stirs as it sails, now grave and now acute,",

  "Wakening the leaves and waves, ere it has passed",
  "To such brief unison as on the brain",
  "One tone, which never can recur, has cast,",
  "One accent never to return again.",

  "The world is full of Woodmen who expel",
  "Love's gentle Dryads from the haunts of life,",
  "And vex the nightingales in every dell.",
  "",
  "Let those who pine in pride or in revenge,",
  "Or think that ill for ill should be repaid,",

  "So Monarchy succeeds to Freedom's foison.",
  "",
  "In Pisa's church a cup of sculptured gold",
  "Was brimming with the blood of feuds forsworn:",
  "A Sacrament more holy ne'er of old",
  "Etrurians mingled mid the shades forlorn",
  "Of moon-illumined forests, when...",

  "O foster-nurse of man's abandoned glory,",
  "Since Athens, its great mother, sunk in splendour;",
  "Thou shadowest forth that mighty shape in story,",
  "As ocean its wrecked fanes, severe yet tender:--",
  "The light-invested angel Poesy",
  "Was drawn from the dim world to welcome thee.",
  "",
  "And thou in painting didst transcribe all taught",
  "By loftiest meditations; marble knew",
  "The sculptor's fearless soul--and as he wrought,",
  "The grace of his own power and freedom grew.",
  "And more than all, heroic, just, sublime,",
  "Thou wart among the false...was this thy crime?",
  "",
  "Yes; and on Pisa's marble walls the twine",
  "Of direst weeds hangs garlanded--the snake",
  "Inhabits its wrecked palaces;--in thine",
  "A beast of subtler venom now doth make",
  "Its lair, and sits amid their glories overthrown,",
  "And thus thy victim's fate is as thine own.",
  "",
  "The sweetest flowers are ever frail and rare,",
  "And love and freedom blossom but to wither;",
  "And good and ill like vines entangled are,",

  "",
  "...",
  "",
  "No record of his crime remains in story,",
  "But if the morning bright as evening shone,",

  "Alone, as you may guess, to banishment.",
  "",
  "Amid the mountains, like a hunted beast,",
  "He hid himself, and hunger, toil, and cold,",
  "Month after month endured; it was a feast",
  "Whene'er he found those globes of deep-red gold",
  "Which in the woods the strawberry-tree doth bear,",
  "Suspended in their emerald atmosphere.",
  "",
  "And in the roofless huts of vast morasses,",
  "Deserted by the fever-stricken serf,",
  "All overgrown with reeds and long rank grasses,",
  "And hillocks heaped of moss-inwoven turf,",
  "And where the huge and speckled aloe made,",
  "Rooted in stones, a broad and pointed shade,--",
  "",
  "He housed himself. There is a point of strand",
  "Near Vado's tower and town; and on one side",
  "The treacherous marsh divides it from the land,",
  "Shadowed by pine and ilex forests wide,",
  "And on the other, creeps eternally,",
  "Through muddy weeds, the shallow sullen sea.",
  "",
  "Here the earth's breath is pestilence, and few",
  "But things whose nature is at war with life--",
  "Snakes and ill worms--endure its mortal dew.",
  "The trophies of the clime's victorious strife--",
  "And ringed horns which the buffalo did wear,",
  "And the wolf's dark gray scalp who tracked him there.",
  "",
  "And at the utmost point...stood there",
  "The relics of a reed-inwoven cot,",
  "Thatched with broad flags. An outlawed murderer",
  "Had lived seven days there: the pursuit was hot",
  "When he was cold. The birds that were his grave",
  "Fell dead after their feast in Vado's wave.",
  "",
  "There must have burned within Marenghi's breast",
  "That fire, more warm and bright than life and hope,",
  "(Which to the martyr makes his dungeon...",

  "To his oppressor), warring with decay,--",
  "Or he could ne'er have lived years, day by day.",
  "",
  "Nor was his state so lone as you might think.",
  "He had tamed every newt and snake and toad,",
  "And every seagull which sailed down to drink",
  "Those freshes ere the death-mist went abroad.",
  "And each one, with peculiar talk and play,",
  "Wiled, not untaught, his silent time away.",
  "",
  "And the marsh-meteors, like tame beasts, at night",
  "Came licking with blue tongues his veined feet;",
  "And he would watch them, as, like spirits bright,",
  "In many entangled figures quaint and sweet",
  "To some enchanted music they would dance--",
  "Until they vanished at the first moon-glance.",
  "",
  "He mocked the stars by grouping on each weed",
  "The summer dew-globes in the golden dawn;",

  "Its pictured path, as on bare spots of lawn",
  "Its delicate brief touch in silver weaves",
  "The likeness of the wood's remembered leaves.",
  "",
  "And many a fresh Spring morn would he awaken--",
  "While yet the unrisen sun made glow, like iron",
  "Quivering in crimson fire, the peaks unshaken",
  "Of mountains and blue isles which did environ",
  "With air-clad crags that plain of land and sea,--",
  "And feel ... liberty.",
  "",
  "And in the moonless nights when the dun ocean",
  "Heaved underneath wide heaven, star-impearled,",
  "Starting from dreams...",
  "Communed with the immeasurable world;",
  "And felt his life beyond his limbs dilated,",
  "Till his mind grew like that it contemplated.",

  "His food was the wild fig and strawberry;",
  "The milky pine-nuts which the autumn-blast",
  "Shakes into the tall grass; or such small fry",
  "As from the sea by winter-storms are cast;",

  "Knotted in clumps under the spongy ground.",
  "",
  "And so were kindled powers and thoughts which made",
  "His solitude less dark. When memory came",
  "(For years gone by leave each a deepening shade),",
  "His spirit basked in its internal flame,--",

  "A black ship walk over the crimson ocean,--",
  "Its pennon streaming on the blasts that fan it,",
