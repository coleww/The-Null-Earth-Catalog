  "The morning watch was come; the vessel lay",
  "Her course, and gently made her liquid way;",
  "The cloven billow flashed from off her prow",

  "The waters with their world were all before;",
  "Behind, the South Sea's many an islet shore.",
  "The quiet night, now dappling, 'gan to wane,",
  "Dividing darkness from the dawning main;",
  "The dolphins, not unconscious of the day,",
  "Swam high, as eager of the coming ray;",
  "The stars from broader beams began to creep,",
  "And lift their shining eyelids from the deep;",
  "The sail resumed its lately shadowed white,",
  "And the wind fluttered with a freshening flight;",
  "The purpling Ocean owns the coming Sun,",
  "But ere he break--a deed is to be done.",
  "",
  "The gallant Chief within his cabin slept,",
  "Secure in those by whom the watch was kept:",
  "His dreams were of Old England's welcome shore,",
  "Of toils rewarded, and of dangers o'er;",
  "His name was added to the glorious roll",
  "Of those who search the storm-surrounded Pole.",
  "The worst was over, and the rest seemed sure,",
  "And why should not his slumber be secure?",
  "Alas! his deck was trod by unwilling feet,",
  "And wilder hands would hold the vessel's sheet;",
  "Young hearts, which languished for some sunny isle,",
  "Where summer years and summer women smile;",
  "Men without country, who, too long estranged,",
  "Had found no native home, or found it changed,",

  "Of some soft savage to the uncertain wave--",
  "The gushing fruits that nature gave unfilled;",
  "The wood without a path--but where they willed;",
  "The field o'er which promiscuous Plenty poured",
  "Her horn; the equal land without a lord;",
  "The wish--which ages have not yet subdued",
  "In man--to have no master save his mood;",
  "The earth, whose mine was on its face, unsold,",
  "The glowing sun and produce all its gold;",

  "Awake, bold Bligh! the foe is at the gate!",
  "Awake! awake!----Alas! it is too late!",
  "Fiercely beside thy cot the mutineer",
  "Stands, and proclaims the reign of rage and fear.",
  "Thy limbs are bound, the bayonet at thy breast;",
  "The hands, which trembled at thy voice, arrest;",
  "Dragged o'er the deck, no more at thy command",
  "The obedient helm shall veer, the sail expand;",
  "That savage Spirit, which would lull by wrath",
  "Its desperate escape from Duty's path,",

  "Close to thy throat the pointed bayonet laid.",
  "The levelled muskets circle round thy breast",
  "In hands as steeled to do the deadly rest.",
  "Thou dar'st them to their worst, exclaiming--\"Fire!\"",

  "The Saturnalia of unhoped-for power?",
  "The boat is lowered with all the haste of hate,",
  "With its slight plank between thee and thy fate;",
  "Her only cargo such a scant supply",
  "As promises the death their hands deny;",
  "And just enough of water and of bread",
  "To keep, some days, the dying from the dead:",
  "Some cordage, canvass, sails, and lines, and twine,",
  "But treasures all to hermits of the brine,",
  "Were added after, to the earnest prayer",
  "Of those who saw no hope, save sea and air;",
  "And last, that trembling vassal of the Pole--",
  "The feeling compass--Navigation's soul.",
  "",
  "And now the self-elected Chief finds time",
  "To stun the first sensation of his crime,",

  "The wealth unhoarded, and the love unbought;",
  "Could these have charms for rudest sea-boys, driven",
  "Before the mast by every wind of heaven?",
  "And now, even now prepared with others' woes",
  "To earn mild Virtue's vain desire, repose?",
  "Alas! such is our nature! all but aim",
  "At the same end by pathways not the same;",
  "Our means--our birth--our nation, and our name,",
  "Our fortune--temper--even our outward frame,",
  "Are far more potent o'er our yielding clay",
  "Than aught we know beyond our little day.",
  "Yet still there whispers the small voice within,",
  "Heard through Gain's silence, and o'er Glory's din:",
  "Whatever creed be taught, or land be trod,",
  "Man's conscience is the Oracle of God.",
  "",
  "The launch is crowded with the faithful few",
  "Who wait their Chief, a melancholy crew:",
  "But some remained reluctant on the deck",
  "Of that proud vessel--now a moral wreck--",
  "And viewed their Captain's fate with piteous eyes;",
  "While others scoffed his augured miseries,",
  "Sneered at the prospect of his pigmy sail,",
  "And the slight bark so laden and so frail.",
  "The tender nautilus, who steers his prow,",
  "The sea-born sailor of his shell canoe,",

  "Seems far less fragile, and, alas! more free.",
  "He, when the lightning-winged Tornados sweep",
  "The surge, is safe--his port is in the deep--",
  "And triumphs o'er the armadas of Mankind,",
  "Which shake the World, yet crumble in the wind.",
  "",
  "When all was now prepared, the vessel clear",

  "A seaman, less obdurate than his mates,",
  "Showed the vain pity which but irritates;",
  "Watched his late Chieftain with exploring eye,",
  "And told, in signs, repentant sympathy;",
  "Held the moist shaddock to his parched mouth,",
  "Which felt Exhaustion's deep and bitter drouth.",
  "But soon observed, this guardian was withdrawn,",
  "Nor further Mercy clouds Rebellion's dawn.",
  "Then forward stepped the bold and froward boy",
  "His Chief had cherished only to destroy,",
  "And, pointing to the helpless prow beneath,",
  "Exclaimed, \"Depart at once! delay is death!\"",
  "Yet then, even then, his feelings ceased not all:",
  "In that last moment could a word recall",
  "Remorse for the black deed as yet half done,",
  "And what he hid from many showed to one:",
  "When Bligh in stern reproach demanded where",
  "Was now his grateful sense of former care?",
  "Where all his hopes to see his name aspire,",
  "And blazon Britain's thousand glories higher?",
  "His feverish lips thus broke their gloomy spell,",
  "\"Tis that! 'tis that! I am in hell! in hell!\"",

  "Their days of danger, and their nights of pain;",
  "Their manly courage even when deemed in vain;",
  "The sapping famine, rendering scarce a son",
  "Known to his mother in the skeleton;",
  "The ills that lessened still their little store,",
  "And starved even Hunger till he wrung no more;",
  "The varying frowns and favours of the deep,",
  "That now almost ingulfs, then leaves to creep",
  "With crazy oar and shattered strength along",
  "The tide that yields reluctant to the strong;",
  "The incessant fever of that arid thirst",
  "Which welcomes, as a well, the clouds that burst",
  "Above their naked bones, and feels delight",
  "In the cold drenching of the stormy night,",
  "And from the outspread canvass gladly wrings",
  "A drop to moisten Life's all-gasping springs;",
  "The savage foe escaped, to seek again",
  "More hospitable shelter from the main;",

  "Beneath the gulf wherein they boldly leapt?",
  "",
  "Young Neuha plunged into the deep, and he",
  "Followed: her track beneath her native sea",
  "Was as a native's of the element,",
  "So smoothly--bravely--brilliantly she went,",
  "Leaving a streak of light behind her heel,",
  "Which struck and flashed like an amphibious steel,",
  "Closely, and scarcely less expert to trace",
  "The depths where divers hold the pearl in chase,",

  "Whose only portal was the keyless wave,",
  "(A hollow archway by the sun unseen,",
  "Save through the billows' glassy veil of green,",
  "In some transparent ocean holiday,",
  "When all the finny people are at play,)",
  "Wiped with her hair the brine from Torquil's eyes,",

  "Led him to where the rock appeared to jut,",
  "And form a something like a Triton's hut;",

  "With its broad leaf, or turtle-shell which bore",
  "A banquet in the flesh it covered o'er;",
  "The gourd with water recent from the rill,",

  "Who, disappointed of their former chase,",
  "In search of Christian now renewed their race.",
  "Eager with anger, their strong arms made way,",

  "In some bleak crag or deeply-hidden bay:",

  "As his foe fell; then, like a serpent, coiled",
  "His wounded, weary form, to where the steep",
  "Looked desperate as himself along the deep;",
  "Cast one glance back, and clenched his hand, and shook",
