  "These tiny loiterers on the barley's beard,",
  "And happy units of a numerous herd",
  "Of playfellows, the laughing Summer brings,",
  "Mocking the sunshine in their glittering wings,",
  "How merrily they creep, and run, and fly!",
  "No kin they bear to labour's drudgery,",
  "Smoothing the velvet of the pale hedge-rose;",
  "And where they fly for dinner no one knows--",
  "The dew-drops feed them not--they love the shine",
  "Of noon, whose sun may bring them golden wine.",
  "All day they're playing in their Sunday dress--",
  "Till night goes sleep, and they can do no less;",
  "Then, to the heath bell's silken hood they fly,",
  "And like to princes in their slumbers lie,",
  "Secure from night, and dropping dews, and all,",
  "In silken beds and roomy painted hall.",
  "So merrily they spend their summer day,",
  "Now in the cornfields, now the new-mown hay.",
  "One almost fancies that such happy things,",
  "With coloured hoods and richly burnished wings,",
  "Are fairy folk, in splendid masquerade",
  "Disguised, as if of mortal folk afraid,",
  "Keeping their merry pranks a mystery still,",
  "Lest glaring day should do their secrets ill.",
