  "Tell then the cause, 'tis sure the avenger's rage",
  "Has swept these myriads from life's crowded stage:",
  "Hark to that groan, an anguished hero dies,",
  "He shudders in death's latest agonies;",

  "'Oh God! my wife, my children--Monarch thou",
  "For whose support this fainting frame lies low;",
  "For whose support in distant lands I bleed,",
  "Let his friends' welfare be the warrior's meed.",

  "When will the sun smile on the bloodless field,",
  "And the stern warrior's arm the sickle wield?",
  "Not whilst some King, in cold ambition's dreams,",
  "Plans for the field of death his plodding schemes;",
  "Not whilst for private pique the public fall,",
  "And one frail mortal's mandate governs all.",
  "Swelled with command and mad with dizzying sway;",

  "And at the orphan's sigh, the widow's moan,",
  "Totters the fabric of thy guilt-stained throne--",
  "'It is thy work, O Monarch;' now the sound",
  "Fainter and fainter, yet is borne around,",
  "Yet to enthusiast ears the murmurs tell",
  "That Heaven, indignant at the work of Hell,",
  "Will soon the cause, the hated cause remove,",
  "Which tears from earth peace, innocence, and love.",
