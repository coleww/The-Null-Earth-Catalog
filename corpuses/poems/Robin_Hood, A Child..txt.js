  "Robin Hood's mother looked out, and said",
  "\"It were a shame and a sin",
  "For fear of getting a wet head",
  "To keep such a day within,",
  "Nor welcome up from his sick bed",
  "Your uncle Gamelyn.\"",
  "",
  "And Robin leaped, and thought so too;",
  "And so he has grasped her gown,",
  "And now looking back, they have lost the view",
  "Of merry sweet Locksley town.",
  "",
  "Robin was a gentle boy,",
  "And therewithal as bold;",
  "To say he was his mother's joy,",
  "It were a phrase too cold.",
  "",
  "His hair upon his thoughtful brow",
  "Came smoothly clipped, and sleek,",
  "But ran into a curl somehow",
  "Beside his merrier cheek.",

  "Great love to him his uncle too",
  "The noble Gamelyn bare,",
  "And often said, as his mother knew,",
  "That he should be his heir.",
  "",
  "Gamelyn's eyes, now getting dim,",
  "Would twinkle at his sight,",

  "Between his locks so white:",

  "For Robin already let him see",
  "He should beat his playmates all",
  "At wrestling, running, and archery,",

  "And would set the old helmets bobbing;",
  "If his uncle asked about the noise,",
  "'Twas \"If you please, Sir, Robin.\"",
  "",
  "And yet if the old man wished no noise,",
  "He'd come and sit at his knee,",
  "And be the gravest of grave-eyed boys;",
  "And not a word spoke he.",
  "",
  "So whenever he and his mother came",
  "To brave old Gamelyn Hall,",
  "'Twas nothing there but sport and game,",
  "And holiday folks all:",
  "The servants never were to blame,",

  "Robin laughed, and the lady too,",
  "And they looked at one another;",
  "Says Robin, \"I'll knock, as I'm used to do,",
  "At uncle's window, mother.\"",
  "",
  "And so he pick'd up some pebbles and ran,",
  "And jumping higher and higher,",
  "He reach'd the windows with tan a ran tan,",
  "And instead of the kind old white-haired man,",
  "There looked out a fat friar.",

  "\"How now,\" said the fat friar angrily,",
  "\"What is this knocking so wild?\"",
  "But when he saw young Robin's eye,",
  "He said \"Go round, my child.",

  "\"He'll tell us all!\" thought Robin;",

  "Weeping all the way,",
  "Until they came where the lord of that land",
  "Dumb in his cold bed lay.",

  "His hand she took, and saw his dead look,",
  "With the lids over each eye-ball;",
  "And Robin and she wept as plenteously,",
  "As though he had left them all.",
  "",
  "\"I will return, Sir Abbot of Vere,",
  "I will return as is meet,",
  "And see my honoured brother dear",
  "Laid in his winding sheet.",
  "",
  "And I will stay, for to go were a sin,",
  "For all a woman's tears,",
  "And see the noble Gamelyn",
  "Laid low with the De Veres.\"",
  "",
  "The lady went with a sick heart out",
  "Into the kind fresh air,",

  "The abbot whom he saw there:",

  "",
  "That self-same evening, nevertheless,",
  "They returned to Locksley town,",
  "The lady in a dumb distress,",
  "And Robin looking down.",

  "They went, and went, and Robin took",

  "\"I was thinking, mother,\" said little Robin,",
  "And with his own voice so true",
  "He spoke right out, \"That if I was a king,",
  "I'd see what those friars do.\"",

  "His mother stooped with a tear of joy,",
  "And she kissed him again and again,",
  "And said, \"My own little Robin boy,",
  "Thou wilt be a King of Men!\"",
