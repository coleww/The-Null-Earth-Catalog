  "On the eighteenth of October we lay in Bantry Bay,",
  "  All ready to set sail, with a fresh and steady gale:",
  "A fortnight and nine days we in the harbour lay,",
  "  And no breeze ever reached us or strained a single sail.",
  "Three ships of war had we, and the great guns loaded all;",
  "  But our ships were dead and beaten that had never feared a foe.",

  "On the nineteenth of October, by eleven of the clock,",
  "  The sky turned black as midnight and a sudden storm came on--",
  "Awful and sudden--and the cables felt the shock;",
  "  Our anchors they all broke away and every sheet was gone.",
  "The guns fired off amid the strife, but little hope had we;",
  "  The billows broke above the ship and left us all below.",
  "The crew with one consent cried \"Bear further out to sea,\"",
  "  But the waves obeyed no sailor's call, and we knew not where to go.",

  "  And staggered like a mountain drunk, wedged in the waves almost.",
  "The red hot boiling billows foamed in the stooping clouds,",
  "  And in that fatal tempest the whole ship's crew were lost.",
  "Have pity for poor mariners, ye landsmen, in a storm.",
  "  O think what they endure at sea while safe at home you stay.",
  "All ye that sleep on beds at night in houses dry and warm,",
  "  O think upon the whole ship's crew, all lost at Bantry Bay.",
