  "  In every town, where Thamis rolls his tyde,",
  "    A narrow pass there is, with houses low;",
  "  Where ever and anon the stream is eyed,",
  "    And many a boat soft sliding to and fro.",
  "    There oft are heard the notes of infant woe,",
  "  The short thick sob, loud scream, and shriller squall:",
  "    How can ye, mothers, vex your children so?",
  "  Some play, some eat, some cack against the wall,",
  "  And as they crouchen low, for bread and butter call.",
  "",
  "  And on the broken pavement, here and there,",
  "    Doth many a stinking sprat and herring lie;",
  "  A brandy and tobacco shop is near,",
  "    And hens, and dogs, and hogs are feeding by;",
  "    And here a sailor's jacket hangs to dry.",
  "  At every door are sunburnt matrons seen,",
  "    Mending old nets to catch the scaly fry;",
  "  Now singing shrill, and scolding oft between;",
  "  Scolds answer foul-mouth'd scolds; bad neighbourhood, I ween.",
  "",
  "  The snappish cur (the passenger's annoy)",
  "    Close at my heel with yelping treble flies;",
  "  The whimpering girl, and hoarser-screaming boy,",
  "    Join to the yelping treble shrilling cries;",
  "    The scolding quean to louder notes doth rise,",
  "  And her full pipes those shrilling cries confound;",
  "    To her full pipes the grunting hog replies;",
  "  The grunting hogs alarm the neighbours round,",
  "  And curs, girls, boys, and scolds, in the deep base are drown'd.",
  "",
  "  Hard by a sty, beneath a roof of thatch,",
  "    Dwelt Obloquy, who in her early days",
  "  Baskets of fish at Billingsgate did watch,",
  "    Cod, whiting, oyster, mack'rel, sprat, or plaice:",
  "    There learn'd she speech from tongues that never cease.",
  "  Slander beside her, like a magpie, chatters,",
  "    With Envy (spitting cat!), dread foe to peace;",
  "  Like a cursed cur, Malice before her clatters,",
  "  And vexing every wight, tears clothes and all to tatters.",
  "",
  "  Her dugs were mark'd by every collier's hand,",
  "    Her mouth was black as bull-dog's at the stall:",
  "  She scratchèd, bit, and spared ne lace ne band,",
  "    And 'bitch' and 'rogue' her answer was to all;",
  "    Nay, even the parts of shame by name would call:",
  "  Yea, when she passèd by or lane or nook,",
  "    Would greet the man who turn'd him to the wall,",
  "  And by his hand obscene the porter took,",
  "  Nor ever did askance like modest virgin look.",
  "",
  "  Such place hath Deptford, navy-building town,",
  "    Woolwich and Wapping, smelling strong of pitch;",
  "  Such Lambeth, envy of each band and gown,",
  "    And Twick'nam such, which fairer scenes enrich,",
  "    Grots, stutues, urns, and Jo--n's dog and bitch,",
  "  Ne village is without, on either side,",
  "    All up the silver Thames, or all adown;",
  "  Ne Richmond's self, from whose tall front are eyed",
  "  Vales, spires, meandering streams, and Windsor's towery pride.",
