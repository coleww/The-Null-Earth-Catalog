  "Now Autumn's fire burns slowly along the woods,",
  "And day by day the dead leaves fall and melt,",
  "And night by night the monitory blast",
  "Wails in the key-hold, telling how it pass'd",
  "O'er empty fields, or upland solitudes,",
  "Or grim wide wave; and now the power is felt",
  "Of melancholy, tenderer in its moods",
  "Than any joy indulgent summer dealt.",

  "Pensive and glad, with tones that recognise",
  "The soft invisible dew in each one's eyes,",
  "It may be, somewhat thus we shall have leave",
  "To walk with memory,--when distant lies",
  "Poor Earth, where we were wont to live and grieve.",
