  "WHEN from the craggy mountain's pathless steep,",
  "Whose flinty brow hangs o'er the raging sea,",

  "When at my matin pray'rs I prostrate kneel,",
  "And Court RELIGION's aid to soothe my woe,",
  "The meek-ey'd saint who pities what I feel,",
  "Forbids the sigh to heave, the tear to flow;",
  "For ah ! no vulgar passion fills my mind,",
  "Calm REASON's hand illumes the flame refin'd,",
  "ALL the pure feelings FRIENDSHIP can impart,",
  "Live in the centre of my aching heart.",

  "My fev'rish lids no balmy slumbers own,",
  "Still my sad bosom beats for thee alone:",
  "Nor shall its aching fibres cease to smart,",
