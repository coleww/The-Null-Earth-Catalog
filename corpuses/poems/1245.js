  "When the last sunshine of expiring Day",
  "In Summer's twilight weeps itself away,",
  "Who hath not felt the softness of the hour",
  "Sink on the heart, as dew along the flower?",
  "With a pure feeling which absorbs and awes",
  "While Nature makes that melancholy pause--",
  "Her breathing moment on the bridge where Time",
  "Of light and darkness forms an arch sublime--",
  "Who hath not shared that calm, so still and deep,",
  "The voiceless thought which would not speak but weep,",
  "A holy concord, and a bright regret,",
  "A glorious sympathy with suns that set?",
  "'Tis not harsh sorrow, but a tenderer woe,",
  "Nameless, but dear to gentle hearts below,",
  "Felt without bitterness--but full and clear,",
  "A sweet dejection--a transparent tear,",
  "Unmixed with worldly grief or selfish stain--",
  "Shed without shame, and secret without pain.",
  "Even as the tenderness that hour instils",
  "When Summer's day declines along the hills,",
  "So feels the fulness of our heart and eyes",
  "When all of Genius which can perish dies.",
  "A mighty Spirit is eclipsed--a Power",

  "The enduring produce of immortal Mind;",
  "Fruits of a genial morn, and glorious noon,",
  "A deathless part of him who died too soon.",
  "But small that portion of the wondrous whole,",
  "These sparkling segments of that circling Soul,",
  "Which all embraced, and lightened over all,",
  "To cheer--to pierce--to please--or to appal.",
  "From the charmed council to the festive board,",
  "Of human feelings the unbounded lord;",
  "In whose acclaim the loftiest voices vied,",
  "The praised--the proud--who made his praise their pride.",
  "When the loud cry of trampled Hindostan",
  "Arose to Heaven in her appeal from Man,",
  "His was the thunder--his the avenging rod,",
  "The wrath--the delegated voice of God!",
  "Which shook the nations through his lips, and blazed",
  "Till vanquished senates trembled as they praised.",
  "",
  "And here, oh! here, where yet all young and warm,",
  "The gay creations of his spirit charm,",
  "The matchless dialogue--the deathless wit,",
  "Which knew not what it was to intermit;",
  "The glowing portraits, fresh from life, that bring",
  "Home to our hearts the truth from which they spring;",
  "These wondrous beings of his fancy, wrought",
  "To fulness by the fiat of his thought,",
  "Here in their first abode you still may meet,",
  "Bright with the hues of his Promethean heat;",
  "A Halo of the light of other days,",
  "Which still the splendour of its orb betrays.",
  "But should there be to whom the fatal blight",
  "Of failing Wisdom yields a base delight,",
  "Men who exult when minds of heavenly tone",
  "Jar in the music which was born their own,",

  "Behold the host! delighting to deprave,",
  "Who track the steps of Glory to the grave,",
  "Watch every fault that daring Genius owes",
  "Half to the ardour which its birth bestows,",
  "Distort the truth, accumulate the lie,",
  "And pile the Pyramid of Calumny!",
  "These are his portion--but if joined to these",
  "Gaunt Poverty should league with deep Disease,",
  "If the high Spirit must forget to soar,",
  "And stoop to strive with Misery at the door,",
  "To soothe Indignity--and face to face",
  "Meet sordid Rage, and wrestle with Disgrace,",
  "To find in Hope but the renewed caress,",
  "The serpent-fold of further Faithlessness:--",
  "If such may be the Ills which men assail,",

  "Ye men of wit and social eloquence!",
  "He was your brother--bear his ashes hence!",
  "While Powers of mind almost of boundless range,",
  "Complete in kind, as various in their change,",
  "While Eloquence--Wit--Poesy--and Mirth,",
  "That humbler Harmonist of care on Earth,",
  "Survive within our souls--while lives our sense",
  "Of pride in Merit's proud pre-eminence,",
  "Long shall we seek his likeness--long in vain,",
  "And turn to all of him which may remain,",
  "Sighing that Nature formed but one such man,",
  "And broke the die--in moulding Sheridan!",
