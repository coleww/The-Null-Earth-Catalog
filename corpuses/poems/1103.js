  "The Serfs are glad through Lara's wide domain,",
  "And Slavery half forgets her feudal chain;",
  "He, their unhoped, but unforgotten lord,",
  "The long self-exiled Chieftain, is restored:",
  "There be bright faces in the busy hall,",
  "Bowls on the board, and banners on the wall;",
  "Far checkering o'er the pictured window, plays",
  "The unwonted faggot's hospitable blaze;",
  "And gay retainers gather round the hearth,",
  "With tongues all loudness, and with eyes all mirth.",
  "",
  "The Chief of Lara is returned again:",
  "And why had Lara crossed the bounding main?",
  "Left by his Sire, too young such loss to know,",
  "Lord of himself,--that heritage of woe,",
  "That fearful empire which the human breast",
  "But holds to rob the heart within of rest!--",
  "With none to check, and few to point in time",
  "The thousand paths that slope the way to crime;",
  "Then, when he most required commandment, then",
  "Had Lara's daring boyhood governed men.",
  "It skills not, boots not step by step to trace",
  "His youth through all the mazes of its race;",
  "Short was the course his restlessness had run,",
  "But long enough to leave him half undone.",
  "",
  "And Lara left in youth his father-land;",
  "But from the hour he waved his parting hand",
  "Each trace waxed fainter of his course, till all",
  "Had nearly ceased his memory to recall.",
  "His sire was dust, his vassals could declare,",
  "'Twas all they knew, that Lara was not there;",
  "Nor sent, nor came he, till conjecture grew",
  "Cold in the many, anxious in the few.",
  "His hall scarce echoes with his wonted name,",
  "His portrait darkens in its fading frame,",
  "Another chief consoled his destined bride,",
  "The young forgot him, and the old had died;",
  "\"Yet doth he live!\" exclaims the impatient heir,",
  "And sighs for sables which he must not wear.",
  "A hundred scutcheons deck with gloomy grace",
  "The Laras' last and longest dwelling-place;",
  "But one is absent from the mouldering file,",
  "That now were welcome in that Gothic pile.",
  "",
  "He comes at last in sudden loneliness,",
  "And whence they know not, why they need not guess;",
  "They more might marvel, when the greeting's o'er",
  "Not that he came, but came not long before:",
  "No train is his beyond a single page,",
  "Of foreign aspect, and of tender age.",
  "Years had rolled on, and fast they speed away",
  "To those that wander as to those that stay;",
  "But lack of tidings from another clime",
  "Had lent a flagging wing to weary Time.",
  "They see, they recognise, yet almost deem",
  "The present dubious, or the past a dream.",

  "Though seared by toil, and something touched by Time;",
  "His faults, whate'er they were, if scarce forgot,",
  "Might be untaught him by his varied lot;",
  "Nor good nor ill of late were known, his name",
  "Might yet uphold his patrimonial fame:",
  "His soul in youth was haughty, but his sins",
  "No more than pleasure from the stripling wins;",
  "And such, if not yet hardened in their course,",
  "Might be redeemed, nor ask a long remorse.",
  "",

  "That brow in furrowed lines had fixed at last,",
  "And spake of passions, but of passion past:",
  "The pride, but not the fire, of early days,",
  "Coldness of mien, and carelessness of praise;",
  "A high demeanour, and a glance that took",
  "Their thoughts from others by a single look;",
  "And that sarcastic levity of tongue,",
  "The stinging of a heart the world hath stung,",
  "That darts in seeming playfulness around,",
  "And makes those feel that will not own the wound;",
  "All these seemed his, and something more beneath",
  "Than glance could well reveal, or accent breathe.",
  "Ambition, Glory, Love, the common aim,",
  "That some can conquer, and that all would claim,",
  "Within his breast appeared no more to strive,",
  "Yet seemed as lately they had been alive;",
  "And some deep feeling it were vain to trace",
  "At moments lightened o'er his livid face.",
  "",
  "Not much he loved long question of the past,",
  "Nor told of wondrous wilds, and deserts vast,",
  "In those far lands where he had wandered lone,",
  "And--as himself would have it seem--unknown:",
  "Yet these in vain his eye could scarcely scan,",
  "Nor glean experience from his fellow man;",
  "But what he had beheld he shunned to show,",
  "As hardly worth a stranger's care to know;",
  "If still more prying such inquiry grew,",
  "His brow fell darker, and his words more few.",
  "",
  "Not unrejoiced to see him once again,",
  "Warm was his welcome to the haunts of men;",
  "Born of high lineage, linked in high command,",

  "And saw them smile or sigh their hours away;",
  "But still he only saw, and did not share,",
  "The common pleasure or the general care;",
  "He did not follow what they all pursued",
  "With hope still baffled still to be renewed;",
  "Nor shadowy Honour, nor substantial Gain,",
  "Nor Beauty's preference, and the rival's pain:",
  "Around him some mysterious circle thrown",
  "Repelled approach, and showed him still alone;",
  "Upon his eye sat something of reproof,",
  "That kept at least Frivolity aloof;",
  "And things more timid that beheld him near",
  "In silence gazed, or whispered mutual fear;",
  "And they the wiser, friendlier few confessed",
  "They deemed him better than his air expressed.",
  "",
  "Twas strange--in youth all action and all life,",
  "Burning for pleasure, not averse from strife;",
  "Woman--the Field--the Ocean, all that gave",
  "Promise of gladness, peril of a grave,",
  "In turn he tried--he ransacked all below,",
  "And found his recompense in joy or woe,",
  "No tame, trite medium; for his feelings sought",
  "In that intenseness an escape from thought:",
  "The Tempest of his Heart in scorn had gazed",
  "On that the feebler Elements hath raised;",
  "The Rapture of his Heart had looked on high,",
  "And asked if greater dwelt beyond the sky:",
  "Chained to excess, the slave of each extreme,",
  "How woke he from the wildness of that dream!",
  "Alas! he told not--but he did awake",
  "To curse the withered heart that would not break.",
  "",
  "Books, for his volume heretofore was Man,",
  "With eye more curious he appeared to scan,",
  "And oft in sudden mood, for many a day,",
  "From all communion he would start away:",
  "And then, his rarely called attendants said,",
  "Through night's long hours would sound his hurried tread",
  "O'er the dark gallery, where his fathers frowned",
  "In rude but antique portraiture around:",
  "They heard, but whispered--\"_that_ must not be known--",
  "The sound of words less earthly than his own.",
  "Yes, they who chose might smile, but some had seen",
  "They scarce knew what, but more than should have been.",
  "Why gazed he so upon the ghastly head",
  "Which hands profane had gathered from the dead,",
  "That still beside his opened volume lay,",
  "As if to startle all save him away?",
  "Why slept he not when others were at rest?",
  "Why heard no music, and received no guest?",
  "All was not well, they deemed--but where the wrong?",
  "Some knew perchance--but 'twere a tale too long;",
  "And such besides were too discreetly wise,",
  "To more than hint their knowledge in surmise;",
  "But if they would--they could\"--around the board",
  "Thus Lara's vassals prattled of their lord.",
  "",
  "It was the night--and Lara's glassy stream",
  "The stars are studding, each with imaged beam;",
  "So calm, the waters scarcely seem to stray,",
  "And yet they glide like Happiness away;",
  "Reflecting far and fairy-like from high",
  "The immortal lights that live along the sky:",
  "Its banks are fringed with many a goodly tree,",
  "And flowers the fairest that may feast the bee;",
  "Such in her chaplet infant Dian wove,",
  "And Innocence would offer to her love.",
  "These deck the shore; the waves their channel make",
  "In windings bright and mazy like the snake.",
  "All was so still, so soft in earth and air,",
  "You scarce would start to meet a spirit there;",
  "Secure that nought of evil could delight",
  "To walk in such a scene, on such a night!",
  "It was a moment only for the good:",
  "So Lara deemed, nor longer there he stood,",
  "But turned in silence to his castle-gate;",
  "Such scene his soul no more could contemplate:",
  "Such scene reminded him of other days,",
  "Of skies more cloudless, moons of purer blaze,",
  "Of nights more soft and frequent, hearts that now--",
  "No--no--the storm may beat upon his brow,",
  "Unfelt, unsparing--but a night like this,",
  "A night of Beauty, mocked such breast as his.",
  "",
  "He turned within his solitary hall,",
  "And his high shadow shot along the wall:",
  "There were the painted forms of other times,",
  "'Twas all they left of virtues or of crimes,",
  "Save vague tradition; and the gloomy vaults",
  "That hid their dust, their foibles, and their faults;",
  "And half a column of the pompous page,",
  "That speeds the specious tale from age to age;",
  "Where History's pen its praise or blame supplies,",
  "And lies like Truth, and still most truly lies.",
  "He wandering mused, and as the moonbeam shone",
  "Through the dim lattice, o'er the floor of stone,",
  "And the high fretted roof, and saints, that there",
  "O'er Gothic windows knelt in pictured prayer,",
  "Reflected in fantastic figures grew,",
  "Like life, but not like mortal life, to view;",
  "His bristling locks of sable, brow of gloom,",
  "And the wide waving of his shaken plume,",
  "Glanced like a spectre's attributes--and gave",
  "His aspect all that terror gives the grave.",
  "",
  "'Twas midnight--all was slumber; the lone light",
  "Dimmed in the lamp, as both to break the night.",
  "Hark! there be murmurs heard in Lara's hall--",
  "A sound--a voice--a shriek--a fearful call!",
  "A long, loud shriek--and silence--did they hear",
  "That frantic echo burst the sleeping ear?",
  "They heard and rose, and, tremulously brave,",
  "Rush where the sound invoked their aid to save;",
  "They come with half-lit tapers in their hands,",
  "And snatched in startled haste unbelted brands.",
  "",
  "Cold as the marble where his length was laid,",
  "Pale as the beam that o'er his features played,",
  "Was Lara stretched; his half-drawn sabre near,",
  "Dropped it should seem in more than Nature's fear;",
  "Yet he was firm, or had been firm till now,",
  "And still Defiance knit his gathered brow;",
  "Though mixed with terror, senseless as he lay,",
  "There lived upon his lip the wish to slay;",
  "Some half formed threat in utterance there had died,",
  "Some imprecation of despairing Pride;",
  "His eye was almost sealed, but not forsook,",
  "Even in its trance, the gladiator's look,",
  "That oft awake his aspect could disclose,",
  "And now was fixed in horrible repose.",
  "They raise him--bear him;--hush! he breathes, he speaks,",
  "The swarthy blush recolours in his cheeks,",
  "His lip resumes its red, his eye, though dim,",
  "Rolls wide and wild, each slowly quivering limb",
  "Recalls its function, but his words are strung",
  "In terms that seem not of his native tongue;",
  "Distinct but strange, enough they understand",
  "To deem them accents of another land;",
  "And such they were, and meant to meet an ear",
  "That hears him not--alas! that cannot hear!",
  "",
  "His page approached, and he alone appeared",
  "To know the import of the words they heard;",
  "And, by the changes of his cheek and brow,",
  "They were not such as Lara should avow,",
  "Nor he interpret,--yet with less surprise",
  "Than those around their Chieftain's state he eyes,",
  "But Lara's prostrate form he bent beside,",
  "And in that tongue which seemed his own replied;",
  "And Lara heeds those tones that gently seem",

  "A breast that needed not ideal woe.",
  "",
  "Whate'er his frenzy dreamed or eye beheld,--",
  "If yet remembered ne'er to be revealed,--",
  "Rests at his heart: the customed morning came,",
  "And breathed new vigour in his shaken frame;",

  "And soon the same in movement and in speech,",
  "As heretofore he filled the passing hours,",
  "Nor less he smiles, nor more his forehead lowers,",
  "Than these were wont; and if the coming night",
  "Appeared less welcome now to Lara's sight,",
  "He to his marvelling vassals showed it not,",
  "Whose shuddering proved _their_ fear was less forgot.",
  "In trembling pairs (alone they dared not) crawl",
  "The astonished slaves, and shun the fated hall;",
  "The waving banner, and the clapping door,",
  "The rustling tapestry, and the echoing floor;",
  "The long dim shadows of surrounding trees,",
  "The flapping bat, the night song of the breeze;",
  "Aught they behold or hear their thought appals,",
  "As evening saddens o'er the dark grey walls.",
  "",
  "Vain thought! that hour of ne'er unravelled gloom",
  "Came not again, or Lara could assume",
  "A seeming of forgetfulness, that made",
  "His vassals more amazed nor less afraid.",
  "Had Memory vanished then with sense restored?",
  "Since word, nor look, nor gesture of their lord",
  "Betrayed a feeling that recalled to these",
  "That fevered moment of his mind's disease.",
  "Was it a dream? was his the voice that spoke",
  "Those strange wild accents; his the cry that broke",
  "Their slumber? his the oppressed, o'erlaboured heart",

  "Could he who thus had suffered so forget,",
  "When such as saw that suffering shudder yet?",

  "In that corroding secrecy which gnaws",

  "Not so in him; his breast had buried both,",
  "Nor common gazers could discern the growth",
  "Of thoughts that mortal lips must leave half told;",

  "Waned in its mirth, and withered to a sneer;",
  "That smile might reach his lip, but passed not by,",
  "Nor e'er could trace its laughter to his eye:",
  "Yet there was softness too in his regard,",
  "At times, a heart as not by nature hard,",

  "Such weakness, as unworthy of its pride,",
  "And steeled itself, as scorning to redeem",
  "One doubt from others' half withheld esteem;",
  "In self-inflicted penance of a breast",
  "Which Tenderness might once have wrung from Rest;",
  "In vigilance of Grief that would compel",
  "The soul to hate for having loved too well.",
  "",
  "There was in him a vital scorn of all:",
  "As if the worst had fallen which could befall,",
  "He stood a stranger in this breathing world,",
  "An erring Spirit from another hurled;",
  "A thing of dark imaginings, that shaped",
  "By choice the perils he by chance escaped;",
  "But 'scaped in vain, for in their memory yet",
  "His mind would half exult and half regret:",
  "With more capacity for love than Earth",
  "Bestows on most of mortal mould and birth.",
  "His early dreams of good outstripped the truth,",
  "And troubled Manhood followed baffled Youth;",
  "With thought of years in phantom chase misspent,",
  "And wasted powers for better purpose lent;",
  "And fiery passions that had poured their wrath",
  "In hurried desolation o'er his path,",
  "And left the better feelings all at strife",
  "In wild reflection o'er his stormy life;",
  "But haughty still, and loth himself to blame,",
  "He called on Nature's self to share the shame,",
  "And charged all faults upon the fleshly form",
  "She gave to clog the soul, and feast the worm:",
  "Till he at last confounded good and ill,",
  "And half mistook for fate the acts of will:",
  "Too high for common selfishness, he could",
  "At times resign his own for others' good,",
  "But not in pity--not because he ought,",
  "But in some strange perversity of thought,",
  "That swayed him onward with a secret pride",
  "To do what few or none would do beside;",
  "And this same impulse would, in tempting time,",
  "Mislead his spirit equally to crime;",
  "So much he soared beyond, or sunk beneath,",
  "The men with whom he felt condemned to breathe,",
  "And longed by good or ill to separate",
  "Himself from all who shared his mortal state;",
  "His mind abhorring this had fixed her throne",
  "Far from the world, in regions of her own:",
  "Thus coldly passing all that passed below,",
  "His blood in temperate seeming now would flow:",
  "Ah! happier if it ne'er with guilt had glowed,",
  "But ever in that icy smoothness flowed!",
  "'Tis true, with other men their path he walked,",
  "And like the rest in seeming did and talked,",
  "Nor outraged Reason's rules by flaw nor start,",
  "His Madness was not of the head, but heart;",
  "And rarely wandered in his speech, or drew",
  "His thoughts so forth as to offend the view.",
  "",
  "With all that chilling mystery of mien,",
  "And seeming gladness to remain unseen,",
  "He had (if 'twere not nature's boon) an art",
  "Of fixing memory on another's heart:",

  "Well speeds alike the banquet and the ball;",
  "And the gay dance of bounding Beauty's train",
  "Links grace and harmony in happiest chain:",
  "Blest are the early hearts and gentle hands",
  "That mingle there in well according bands;",

  "",
  "And Lara gazed on these, sedately glad,",

  "Who still till now had gazed on him unseen:",
  "At length encountering meets the mutual gaze",
  "Of keen enquiry, and of mute amaze;",

  "That sprung at first to his arrested eyes",
  "Seemed now subsided--neither sunk nor raised",
  "Glanced his eye round, though still the stranger gazed;",

  "",
  "It were too much for Lara to pass by",

  "Eternity forbids thee to forget.\"",
  "With slow and searching glance upon his face",
  "Grew Lara's eyes, but nothing there could trace",

  "Scarce Kaled seemed to know, but turned away,",
  "As if his heart abhorred that coming day,",
  "And shrunk his glance before that morning light,",
  "To look on Lara's brow--where all grew night.",
  "Yet sense seemed left, though better were its loss;",
  "For when one near displayed the absolving Cross,",
  "And proffered to his touch the holy bead,",
  "Of which his parting soul might own the need,",
  "He looked upon it with an eye profane,",
  "And smiled--Heaven pardon! if 'twere with disdain:",
  "And Kaled, though he spoke not, nor withdrew",
  "From Lara's face his fixed despairing view,",
  "With brow repulsive, and with gesture swift,",
  "Flung back the hand which held the sacred gift,",
  "As if such but disturbed the expiring man,",
  "Nor seemed to know his life but _then_ began--",
  "That Life of Immortality, secure",
  "To none, save them whose faith in Christ is sure.",
  "",
  "But gasping heaved the breath that Lara drew,",
  "And dull the film along his dim eye grew;",
  "His limbs stretched fluttering, and his head drooped o'er",
  "The weak yet still untiring knee that bore;",
  "He pressed the hand he held upon his heart--",
  "It beats no more, but Kaled will not part",
  "With the cold grasp, but feels, and feels in vain,",
  "For that faint throb which answers not again.",
  "\"It beats!\"--Away, thou dreamer! he is gone--",
  "It once _was_ Lara which thou look'st upon.",
  "",
  "He gazed, as if not yet had passed away",
  "The haughty spirit of that humbled clay;",
  "And those around have roused him from his trance,",
  "But cannot tear from thence his fixéd glance;",
  "And when, in raising him from where he bore",
  "Within his arms the form that felt no more,",
  "He saw the head his breast would still sustain,",
  "Roll down like earth to earth upon the plain;",
  "He did not dash himself thereby, nor tear",
  "The glossy tendrils of his raven hair,",
  "But strove to stand and gaze, but reeled and fell,",
  "Scarce breathing more than that he loved so well.",
  "Than that _he_ loved! Oh! never yet beneath",
  "The breast of _man_ such trusty love may breathe!",
  "That trying moment hath at once revealed",
  "The secret long and yet but half concealed;",
  "In baring to revive that lifeless breast,",
  "Its grief seemed ended, but the sex confessed;",
  "And life returned, and Kaled felt no shame--",
  "What now to her was Womanhood or Fame?",
  "",
  "And Lara sleeps not where his fathers sleep,",
  "But where he died his grave was dug as deep;",
  "Nor is his mortal slumber less profound,",
  "Though priest nor blessed nor marble decked the mound,",
  "And he was mourned by one whose quiet grief,",
  "Less loud, outlasts a people's for their Chief.",
  "Vain was all question asked her of the past,",
  "And vain e'en menace--silent to the last;",
  "She told nor whence, nor why she left behind",
  "Her all for one who seemed but little kind.",
  "Why did she love him? Curious fool!--be still--",
  "Is human love the growth of human will?",
  "To her he might be gentleness; the stern",
  "Have deeper thoughts than your dull eyes discern,",
  "And when they love, your smilers guess not how",
  "Beats the strong heart, though less the lips avow.",
  "They were not common links, that formed the chain",
  "That bound to Lara Kaled's heart and brain;",
  "But that wild tale she brooked not to unfold,",
  "And sealed is now each lip that could have told.",
  "",
  "They laid him in the earth, and on his breast,",
  "Besides the wound that sent his soul to rest,",
  "They found the scattered dints of many a scar,",
  "Which were not planted there in recent war;",
  "Where'er had passed his summer years of life,",
  "It seems they vanished in a land of strife;",
  "But all unknown his Glory or his Guilt,",
  "These only told that somewhere blood was spilt,",
  "And Ezzelin, who might have spoke the past,",
  "Returned no more--that night appeared his last.",
  "",
  "Upon that night (a peasant's is the tale)",
  "A Serf that crossed the intervening vale,",
  "When Cynthia's light almost gave way to morn,",
  "And nearly veiled in mist her waning horn;",
  "A Serf, that rose betimes to thread the wood,",
  "And hew the bough that bought his children's food,",
  "Passed by the river that divides the plain",
  "Of Otho's lands and Lara's broad domain:",
  "He heard a tramp--a horse and horseman broke",
  "From out the wood--before him was a cloak",
  "Wrapt round some burthen at his saddle-bow,",
  "Bent was his head, and hidden was his brow.",
  "Roused by the sudden sight at such a time,",
  "And some foreboding that it might be crime,",
  "Himself unheeded watched the stranger's course,",
  "Who reached the river, bounded from his horse,",
  "And lifting thence the burthen which he bore,",
  "Heaved up the bank, and dashed it from the shore,",
  "Then paused--and looked--and turned--and seemed to watch,",
  "And still another hurried glance would snatch,",
  "And follow with his step the stream that flowed,",
  "As if even yet too much its surface showed;",
  "At once he started--stooped--around him strown",
  "The winter floods had scattered heaps of stone:",
  "Of these the heaviest thence he gathered there,",
  "And slung them with a more than common care.",
  "Meantime the Serf had crept to where unseen",
  "Himself might safely mark what this might mean;",
  "He caught a glimpse, as of a floating breast,",
  "And something glittered starlike on the vest;",
  "But ere he well could mark the buoyant trunk,",
  "A massy fragment smote it, and it sunk:",
  "It rose again, but indistinct to view,",
  "And left the waters of a purple hue,",
  "Then deeply disappeared: the horseman gazed",
  "Till ebbed the latest eddy it had raised;",
  "Then turning, vaulted on his pawing steed,",
  "And instant spurred him into panting speed.",
  "His face was masked--the features of the dead,",
  "If dead it were, escaped the observer's dread;",
  "But if in sooth a Star its bosom bore,",
  "Such is the badge that Knighthood ever wore,",
  "And such 'tis known Sir Ezzelin had worn",
  "Upon the night that led to such a morn.",
  "If thus he perished, Heaven receive his soul!",
  "His undiscovered limbs to ocean roll;",
  "And charity upon the hope would dwell",
  "It was not Lara's hand by which he fell.",
  "",
  "And Kaled--Lara--Ezzelin, are gone,",
  "Alike without their monumental stone!",
  "The first, all efforts vainly strove to wean",
  "From lingering where her Chieftain's blood had been:",
  "Grief had so tamed a spirit once too proud,",
  "Her tears were few, her wailing never loud;",
  "But furious would you tear her from the spot",
  "Where yet she scarce believed that he was not,",
  "Her eye shot forth with all the living fire",
  "That haunts the tigress in her whelpless ire;",
  "But left to waste her weary moments there,",
  "She talked all idly unto shapes of air,",
  "Such as the busy brain of Sorrow paints,",
  "And woos to listen to her fond complaints:",
  "And she would sit beneath the very tree",
  "Where lay his drooping head upon her knee;",
  "And in that posture where she saw him fall,",
  "His words, his looks, his dying grasp recall;",
  "And she had shorn, but saved her raven hair,",
  "And oft would snatch it from her bosom there,",
  "And fold, and press it gently to the ground,",
  "As if she staunched anew some phantom's wound.",
  "Herself would question, and for him reply;",
  "Then rising, start, and beckon him to fly",
  "From some imagined Spectre in pursuit;",
  "Then seat her down upon some linden's root,",
  "And hide her visage with her meagre hand,",
  "Or trace strange characters along the sand--",
  "This could not last--she lies by him she loved;",
  "Her tale untold--her truth too dearly proved.",
