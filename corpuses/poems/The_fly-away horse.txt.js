  "That the Fly-Away Horse, with a neigh",
  "And a pull at his rein and a toss of his mane,",
  "Is up on his heels and away!",
  "The Moon in the sky,",

  "Over meadows and lanes, over mountains and plains,",

  "Off! scamper to bed - you shall ride him tonight!",
  "For, as soon as you've fallen asleep,",

  "In those beautiful lands over there,",
  "Where the Fly-Away Horse wings his faraway course",
  "With the wee one consigned to his care.",
  "Then grandma will cry",
  "In amazement: \"Oh, my!\"",
  "And she'll think it could never be so;",
  "And only we two",
