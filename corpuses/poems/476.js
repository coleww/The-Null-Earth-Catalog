  "",
  "BEFORE the starry threshold of Jove's court",
  "My mansion is, where those immortal shapes",
  "Of bright aerial spirits live insphered",
  "In regions mild of calm and serene air,",
  "Above the smoke and stir of this dim spot",
  "Which men call Earth, and, with low-thoughted care,",
  "Confined and pestered in this pinfold here,",
  "Strive to keep up a frail and feverish being,",
  "Unmindful of the crown that Virtue gives,",
  "After this mortal change, to her true servants",
  "Amongst the enthroned gods on sainted seats.",
  "Yet some there be that by due steps aspire",
  "To lay their just hands on that golden key",
  "That opes the palace of eternity.",
  "To Such my errand is; and, but for such,",
  "I would not soil these pure ambrosial weeds",
  "With the rank vapours of this sin-worn mould.",
  "         But to my task. Neptune, besides the sway",
  "Of every salt flood and each ebbing stream,",
  "Took in by lot, 'twixt high and nether Jove,",
  "Imperial rule of all the sea-girt isles",
  "That, like to rich and various gems, inlay",
  "The unadorned bosom of the deep;",
  "Which he, to grace his tributary gods,",
  "By course commits to several government,",
  "And gives them leave to wear their sapphire crowns",
  "And wield their little tridents. But this Isle,",
  "The greatest and the best of all the main,",
  "He quarters to his blue-haired deities;",
  "And all this tract that fronts the falling sun",
  "A noble Peer of mickle trust and power",
  "Has in his charge, with tempered awe to guide",
  "An old and haughty nation, proud in arms:",
  "Where his fair offspring, nursed in princely lore,",
  "Are coming to attend their father's state,",
  "And new-intrusted sceptre. But their way",
  "Lies through the perplexed paths of this drear wood,",
  "The nodding horror of whose shady brows",
  "Threats the forlorn and wandering passenger;",
  "And here their tender age might suffer peril,",
  "But that, by quick command from sovran Jove,",
  "I was despatched for their defence and guard:",
  "And listen why; for I will tell you now",
  "What never yet was heard in tale or song,",
  "From old or modern bard, in hall or bower.",
  "         Bacchus, that first from out the purple grape",
  "Crushed the sweet poison of misused wine,",
  "After the Tuscan mariners transformed,",
  "Coasting the Tyrrhene shore, as the winds listed,",
  "On Circe's island fell. (Who knows not Circe,",
  "The daughter of the Sun, whose charmed cup",
  "Whoever tasted lost his upright shape,",
  "And downward fell into a grovelling swine?)",
  "This Nymph, that gazed upon his clustering locks,",
  "With ivy berries wreathed, and his blithe youth,",
  "Had by him, ere he parted thence, a son",
  "Much like his father, but his mother more,",
  "Whom therefore she brought up, and Comus named:",
  "Who, ripe and frolic of his full-grown age,",
  "Roving the Celtic and Iberian fields,",
  "At last betakes him to this ominous wood,",
  "And, in thick shelter of black shades imbowered,",
  "Excels his mother at her mighty art;",
  "Offering to every weary traveller",
  "His orient liquor in a crystal glass,",
  "To quench the drouth of Phoebus; which as they taste",
  "(For most do taste through fond intemperate thirst),",
  "Soon as the potion works, their human count'nance,",
  "The express resemblance of the gods, is changed",
  "Into some brutish form of wolf or bear,",
  "Or ounce or tiger, hog, or bearded goat,",
  "All other parts remaining as they were.",
  "And they, so perfect is their misery,",
  "Not once perceive their foul disfigurement,",
  "But boast themselves more comely than before,",
  "And all their friends and native home forget,",
  "To roll with pleasure in a sensual sty.",
  "Therefore, when any favoured of high Jove",
  "Chances to pass through this adventurous glade,",
  "Swift as the sparkle of a glancing star",
  "I shoot from heaven, to give him safe convoy,",
  "As now I do. But first I must put off",
  "These my sky-robes, spun out of Iris' woof,",
  "And take the weeds and likeness of a swain",
  "That to the service of this house belongs,",
  "Who, with his soft pipe and smooth-dittied song,",
  "Well knows to still the wild winds when they roar,",
  "And hush the waving woods; nor of less faith",
  "And in this office of his mountain watch",
  "Likeliest, and nearest to the present aid",
  "Of this occasion. But I hear the tread",
  "Of hateful steps; I must be viewless now.",

  "glistering.",
  "They come in making a riotous and unruly noise, with torches in",
  "their hands.",
  "",
  "",
  "         COMUS. The star that bids the shepherd fold",
  "Now the top of heaven doth hold;",
  "And the gilded car of day",
  "His glowing axle doth allay",
  "In the steep Atlantic stream;",
  "And the slope sun his upward beam",
  "Shoots against the dusky pole,",
  "Pacing toward the other goal",
  "Of his chamber in the east.",
  "Meanwhile, welcome joy and feast,",
  "Midnight shout and revelry,",
  "Tipsy dance and jollity.",
  "Braid your locks with rosy twine,",

  "Imitate the starry quire,",
  "Who, in their nightly watchful spheres,",
  "Lead in swift round the months and years.",

  "Of Stygian darkness spets her thickest gloom,",
  "And makes one blot of all the air!",
  "Stay thy cloudy ebon chair,",
  "Wherein thou ridest with Hecat', and befriend",
  "Us thy vowed priests, till utmost end",
  "Of all thy dues be done, and none left out,",

  "         Break off, break off! I feel the different pace",
  "Of some chaste footing near about this ground.",
  "Run to your shrouds within these brakes and trees;",
  "Our number may affright. Some virgin sure",
  "(For so I can distinguish by mine art)",
  "Benighted in these woods! Now to my charms,",
  "And to my wily trains: I shall ere long",
  "Be well stocked with as fair a herd as grazed",
  "About my mother Circe. Thus I hurl",
  "My dazzling spells into the spongy air,",
  "Of power to cheat the eye with blear illusion,",
  "And give it false presentments, lest the place",
  "And my quaint habits breed astonishment,",
  "And put the damsel to suspicious flight;",
  "Which must not be, for that's against my course.",
  "I, under fair pretence of friendly ends,",
  "And well-placed words of glozing courtesy,",
  "Baited with reasons not unplausible,",
  "Wind me into the easy-hearted man,",
  "And hug him into snares. When once her eye",
  "Hath met the virtue of this magic dust,",
  "I shall appear some harmless villager",
  "Whom thrift keeps up about his country gear.",
  "But here she comes; I fairly step aside,",
  "And hearken, if I may her business hear.",
  "",
  "The LADY enters.",
  "",
  "         LADY. This way the noise was, if mine ear be true,",
  "My best guide now. Methought it was the sound",
  "Of riot and ill-managed merriment,",
  "Such as the jocund flute or gamesome pipe",
  "Stirs up among the loose unlettered hinds,",
  "When, for their teeming flocks and granges full,",
  "In wanton dance they praise the bounteous Pan,",
  "And thank the gods amiss. I should be loth",
  "To meet the rudeness and swilled insolence",
  "Of such late wassailers; yet, oh! where else",
  "Shall I inform my unacquainted feet",
  "In the blind mazes of this tangled wood?",
  "My brothers, when they saw me wearied out",
  "With this long way, resolving here to lodge",
  "Under the spreading favour of these pines,",
  "Stepped, as they said, to the next thicket-side",
  "To bring me berries, or such cooling fruit",
  "As the kind hospitable woods provide.",
  "They left me then when the grey-hooded Even,",
  "Like a sad votarist in palmer's weed,",
  "Rose from the hindmost wheels of Phoebus' wain.",
  "But where they are, and why they came not back,",
  "Is now the labour of my thoughts. TTis likeliest",
  "They had engaged their wandering steps too far;",
  "And envious darkness, ere they could return,",
  "Had stole them from me. Else, O thievish Night,",
  "Why shouldst thou, but for some felonious end,",
  "In thy dark lantern thus close up the stars",
  "That Nature hung in heaven, and filled their lamps",
  "With everlasting oil to give due light",
  "To the misled and lonely traveller?",
  "This is the place, as well as I may guess,",
  "Whence even now the tumult of loud mirth",
  "Was rife, and perfect in my listening ear;",
  "Yet nought but single darkness do I find.",
  "What might this be ? A thousand fantasies",
  "Begin to throng into my memory,",
  "Of calling shapes, and beckoning shadows dire,",
  "And airy tongues that syllable men's names",
  "On sands and shores and desert wildernesses.",
  "These thoughts may startle well, but not astound",
  "The virtuous mind, that ever walks attended",
  "By a strong siding champion, Conscience.",
  "O, welcome, pure-eyed Faith, white-handed Hope,",
  "Thou hovering angel girt with golden wings,",
  "And thou unblemished form of Chastity!",
  "I see ye visibly, and now believe",
  "That He, the Supreme Good, to whom all things ill",
  "Are but as slavish officers of vengeance,",
  "Would send a glistering guardian, if need were,",
  "To keep my life and honour unassailed. . . .",
  "Was I deceived, or did a sable cloud",
  "Turn forth her silver lining on the night?",
  "I did not err: there does a sable cloud",
  "Turn forth her silver lining on the night,",
  "And casts a gleam over this tufted grove.",
  "I cannot hallo to my brothers, but",
  "Such noise as I can make to be heard farthest",
  "I'll venture; for my new-enlivened spirits",
  "Prompt me, and they perhaps are not far off.",
  "",
  "Song.",
  "",
  "Sweet Echo, sweetest nymph, that liv'st unseen",
  "                 Within thy airy shell",
  "         By slow Meander's margent green,",
  "And in the violet-embroidered vale",
  "         Where the love-lorn nightingale",
  "Nightly to thee her sad song mourneth well:",
  "Canst thou not tell me of a gentle pair",
  "         That likest thy Narcissus are?",
  "                  O, if thou have",
  "         Hid them in some flowery cave,",
  "                  Tell me but where,",
  "         Sweet Queen of Parley, Daughter of the Sphere!",
  "         So may'st thou be translated to the skies,",
  "And give resounding grace to all Heaven's harmonies!",
  "",
  "",
  "         COMUS. Can any mortal mixture of earthUs mould",
  "Breathe such divine enchanting ravishment?",
  "Sure something holy lodges in that breast,",
  "And with these raptures moves the vocal air",
  "To testify his hidden residence.",
  "How sweetly did they float upon the wings",
  "Of silence, through the empty-vaulted night,",
  "At every fall smoothing the raven down",
  "Of darkness till it smiled! I have oft heard",
  "My mother Circe with the Sirens three,",
  "Amidst the flowery-kirtled Naiades,",
  "Culling their potent herbs and baleful drugs,",
  "Who, as they sung, would take the prisoned soul,",
  "And lap it in Elysium: Scylla wept,",
  "And chid her barking waves into attention,",
  "And fell Charybdis murmured soft applause.",
  "Yet they in pleasing slumber lulled the sense,",
  "And in sweet madness robbed it of itself;",
  "But such a sacred and home-felt delight,",
  "Such sober certainty of waking bliss,",
  "I never heard till now. I'll speak to her,",
  "And she shall be my queen.QHail, foreign wonder!",
  "Whom certain these rough shades did never breed,",
  "Unless the goddess that in rural shrine",
  "Dwell'st here with Pan or Sylvan, by blest song",
  "Forbidding every bleak unkindly fog",
  "To touch the prosperous growth of this tall wood.",
  "         LADY. Nay, gentle shepherd, ill is lost that praise",
  "That is addressed to unattending ears.",
  "Not any boast of skill, but extreme shift",
  "How to regain my severed company,",
  "Compelled me to awake the courteous Echo",
  "To give me answer from her mossy couch.",
  "         COMUS: What chance, good lady, hath bereft you thus?",
  "         LADY. Dim darkness and this leafy labyrinth.",
  "         COMUS. Could that divide you from near-ushering guides?",
  "         LADY. They left me weary on a grassy turf.",
  "         COMUS. By falsehood, or discourtesy, or why?",
  "         LADY. To seek i' the valley some cool friendly spring.",
  "         COMUS. And left your fair side all unguarded, Lady?",
  "         LADY. They were but twain, and purposed quick return.",
  "         COMUS. Perhaps forestalling night prevented them.",
  "         LADY. How easy my misfortune is to hit!",
  "         COMUS. Imports their loss, beside the present need?",
  "         LADY. No less than if I should my brothers lose.",
  "         COMUS. Were they of manly prime, or youthful bloom?",
  "         LADY. As smooth as Hebe's their unrazored lips.",
  "         COMUS. Two such I saw, what time the laboured ox",
  "In his loose traces from the furrow came,",
  "And the swinked hedger at his supper sat.",
  "I saw them under a green mantling vine,",
  "That crawls along the side of yon small hill,",
  "Plucking ripe clusters from the tender shoots;",
  "Their port was more than human, as they stood.",
  "I took it for a faery vision",
  "Of some gay creatures of the element,",
  "That in the colours of the rainbow live,",
  "And play i' the plighted clouds. I was awe-strook,",
  "And, as I passed, I worshiped. If those you seek,",
  "It were a journey like the path to Heaven",
  "To help you find them.",
  "         LADY.                          Gentle villager,",
  "What readiest way would bring me to that place?",
  "         COMUS. Due west it rises from this shrubby point.",
  "         LADY. To find out that, good shepherd, I suppose,",
  "In such a scant allowance of star-light,",
  "Would overtask the best land-pilot's art,",
  "Without the sure guess of well-practised feet.",
  "        COMUS. I know each lane, and every alley green,",
  "Dingle, or bushy dell, of this wild wood,",
  "And every bosky bourn from side to side,",
  "My daily walks and ancient neighbourhood;",
  "And, if your stray attendance be yet lodged,",
  "Or shroud within these limits, I shall know",
  "Ere morrow wake, or the low-roosted lark",
  "From her thatched pallet rouse. If otherwise,",
  "I can conduct you, Lady, to a low",
  "But loyal cottage, where you may be safe",
  "Till further quest.",
  "         LADY.        Shepherd, I take thy word,",
  "And trust thy honest-offered courtesy,",
  "Which oft is sooner found in lowly sheds,",
  "With smoky rafters, than in tapestry halls",
  "And courts of princes, where it first was named,",
  "And yet is most pretended. In a place",
  "Less warranted than this, or less secure,",
  "I cannot be, that I should fear to change it.",
  "Eye me, blest Providence, and square my trial",
  "To my proportioned strength! Shepherd, lead on.",
  "",
  "The TWO BROTHERS.",
  "",
  "         ELD. BRO. Unmuffle, ye faint stars; and thou, fair moon,",
  "That wont'st to love the traveller's benison,",
  "Stoop thy pale visage through an amber cloud,",
  "And disinherit Chaos, that reigns here",
  "In double night of darkness and of shades;",
  "Or, if your influence be quite dammed up",
  "With black usurping mists, some gentle taper,",
  "Though a rush-candle from the wicker hole",
  "Of some clay habitation, visit us",
  "With thy long levelled rule of streaming light,",
  "And thou shalt be our star of Arcady,",
  "Or Tyrian Cynosure.",
  "         SEC. BRO.                    Or, if our eyes",
  "Be barred that happiness, might we but hear",
  "The folded flocks, penned in their wattled cotes,",
  "Or sound of pastoral reed with oaten stops,",
  "Or whistle from the lodge, or village cock",
  "Count the night-watches to his feathery dames,",
  "'T would be some solace yet, some little cheering,",
  "In this close dungeon of innumerous boughs.",
  "But, oh, that hapless virgin, our lost sister!",
  "Where may she wander now, whither betake her",
  "From the chill dew, amongst rude burs and thistles",
  "Perhaps some cold bank is her bolster now,",
  "Or 'gainst the rugged bark of some broad elm",
  "Leans her unpillowed head, fraught with sad fears.",
  "What if in wild amazement and affright,",
  "Or, while we speak, within the direful grasp",
  "Of savage hunger, or of savage heat!",
  "         ELD. BRO. Peace, brother: be not over-exquisite",
  "To cast the fashion of uncertain evils;",
  "For, grant they be so, while they rest unknown,",
  "What need a man forestall his date of grief,",
  "And run to meet what he would most avoid?",
  "Or, if they be but false alarms of fear,",
  "How bitter is such self-delusion!",
  "I do not think my sister so to seek,",
  "Or so unprincipled in virtue's book,",
  "And the sweet peace that goodness bosoms ever,",
  "As that the single want of light and noise",
  "(Not being in danger, as I trust she is not)",
  "Could stir the constant mood of her calm thoughts,",
  "And put them into misbecoming plight.",
  "Virtue could see to do what Virtue would",
  "By her own radiant light, though sun and moon",
  "Were in the flat sea sunk. And Wisdom's self",
  "Oft seeks to sweet retired solitude,",
  "Where, with her best nurse, Contemplation,",
  "She plumes her feathers, and lets grow her wings,",
  "That, in the various bustle of resort,",
  "Were all to-ruffled, and sometimes impaired.",
  "He that has light within his own clear breast",
  "May sit i' the centre, and enjoy bright day:",
  "But he that hides a dark soul and foul thoughts",
  "Benighted walks under the mid-day sun;",
  "Himself is his own dungeon.",
  "         SEC. BRO.                             'Tis most true",
  "That musing meditation most affects",
  "The pensive secrecy of desert cell,",
  "Far from the cheerful haunt of men and herds,",
  "And sits as safe as in a senate house",
  "For who would rob a hermit of his weeds,",
  "His few books, or his beads, or maple dish,",
  "Or do his grey hairs any violence?",
  "But Beauty, like the fair Hesperian tree",
  "Laden with blooming gold, had need the guard",
  "Of dragon-watch with unenchanted eye",
  "To save her blossoms, and defend her fruit,",
  "From the rash hand of bold Incontinence.",
  "You may as well spread out the unsunned heaps",
  "Of miser's treasure by an outlaw's den,",
  "And tell me it is safe, as bid me hope",
  "Danger will wink on Opportunity,",
  "And let a single helpless maiden pass",
  "Uninjured in this wild surrounding waste.",
  "Of night or loneliness it recks me not;",
  "I fear the dread events that dog them both,",

  "Of our unowned sister.",

  "Infer as if I thought my sister's state",
  "Secure without all doubt or controversy;",
  "Yet, where an equal poise of hope and fear",
  "Does arbitrate the event, my nature is",
  "That I incline to hope rather than fear,",

  "As you imagine; she has a hidden strength,",
  "Which you remember not.",

  "No savage fierce, bandite, or mountaineer,",
  "Will dare to soil her virgin purity.",
  "Yea, there where very desolation dwells,",
  "By grots and caverns shagged with horrid shades,",
  "She may pass on with unblenched majesty,",
  "Be it not done in pride, or in presumption.",
  "Some say no evil thing that walks by night,",
  "In fog or fire, by lake or moorish fen,",
  "Blue meagre hag, or stubborn unlaid ghost,",

  "Make her his eternal bride,",
  "And from her fair unspotted side",
  "Two blissful twins are to be born,",
  "Youth and Joy; so Jove hath sworn.",
  "         But now my task is smoothly done:",
  "I can fly, or I can run,",
  "Quickly to the green earth's end,",
  "Where the bowed welkin slow doth bend,",
  "And from thence can soar as soon",
  "To the corners of the moon.",
  "Mortals, that would follow me,",
  "Love virtue; she alone is free.",
  "She can teach ye how to climb",
  "Higher than the sphery chime;",
  "Or, if Virtue feeble were,",
  "Heaven itself would stoop to her.",
