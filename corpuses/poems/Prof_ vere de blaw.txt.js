  "'Nd uv the many features Casey managed to import",
  "The most important wuz a Steenway gran' pianny-fort,",
  "An' bein' there wuz nobody could play upon the same,",
  "He telegraffed to Denver, 'nd a real perfesser came,--",
  "The last an' crownin' glory uv the Casey restauraw",
  "Wuz that tenderfoot musicianer, Perfesser Vere de Blaw!",
  "",
  "His hair wuz long an' dishybill, an' he had a yaller skin,",
  "An' the absence uv a collar made his neck look powerful thin:",
  "A sorry man he wuz to see, az mebby you'd surmise,",
  "But the fire uv inspiration wuz a-blazin' in his eyes!",
  "His name wuz Blanc, wich same is Blaw (for that's what Casey said,",
  "An' Casey passed the French ez well ez any Frenchie bred);",
  "But no one ever reckoned that it really wuz his name,",
  "An' no one ever asked him how or why or whence he came,--",
  "Your ancient history is a thing the Coloradan hates,",
  "An' no one asks another what his name wuz in the States!",
  "",
  "At evenin', when the work wuz done, an' the miners rounded up",
  "At Casey's, to indulge in keerds or linger with the cup,",
  "Or dally with the tabble dote in all its native glory,",

  "Upon the Steenway gran' piannyfort, the wich wuz sot",
  "In the hallway near the kitchen (a warm but quiet spot),",
  "An' when De Blaw's environments induced the proper pride,--",
  "Wich gen'rally wuz whiskey straight, with seltzer on the side,--",
  "He throwed his soulful bein' into opry airs 'nd things",
  "Wich bounded to the ceilin' like he'd mesmerized the strings.",
  "",
  "Oh, you that live in cities where the gran' piannies grow,",
  "An' primy donnies round up, it's little that you know",
  "Uv the hungerin' an' the yearnin' wich us miners an' the rest",
  "Feel for the songs we used to hear before we moved out West.",
  "Yes, memory is a pleasant thing, but it weakens mighty quick;",
  "It kind uv dries an' withers, like the windin' mountain crick,",
  "That, beautiful, an' singin' songs, goes dancin' to the plains,",
  "So long ez it is fed by snows an' watered by the rains;",
  "But, uv that grace uv lovin' rains 'nd mountain snows bereft,",
  "Its bleachin' rocks, like dummy ghosts, is all its memory left.",

  "Or, sometimes, from \"Lee Grond Dooshess\" a trifle he would play,",
  "Or morsoze from a' opry boof, to drive dull care away;",
  "Or, feelin' kind uv serious, he'd discourse somewhat in C,--",
  "The wich he called a' opus (whatever that may be);",
  "But the toons that fetched the likker from the critics in the crowd",

  "One evenin' down at Casey's De Blaw wuz at his best,",
  "With four-fingers uv old Wilier-run concealed beneath his vest;",
  "The boys wuz settin' all around, discussin' folks an' things,",
  "'Nd I had drawed the necessary keerds to fill on kings;",
  "Three-fingered Hoover kind uv leaned acrosst the bar to say",
  "If Casey'd liquidate right off, he'd liquidate next day;",
  "A sperrit uv contentment wuz a-broodin' all around",

  "Stock still we stopped,--some in their talk uv politics an' things,",
  "I in my unobtrusive attempt to fill on kings,",
  "'Nd Hoover leanin' on the bar, an' Casey at the till,--",
  "We all stopped short an' held our breaths (ez a feller sometimes will),",
  "An' sot there more like bumps on logs than healthy, husky men,",
  "Ez the memories uv that old, old toon come sneakin' back again.",
  "",
  "You've guessed it? No, you hav n't; for it wuzn't that there song",
  "Uv the home we'd been away from an' had hankered for so long,--",
  "No, sir; it wuzn't \"Home, Sweet Home,\" though it's always heard around",
  "Sech neighborhoods in wich the home that is \"sweet home\" is found.",
  "And, ez for me, I seemed to see the past come back again,",
  "And hear the deep-drawed sigh my sister Lucy uttered when",
  "Her mother asked her if she 'd practised her two hours that day,",
  "Wich, if she hadn't, she must go an' do it right away!",
  "The homestead in the States 'nd all its memories seemed to come",
