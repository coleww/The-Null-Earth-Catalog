  "  in Death the same as Life,)",
  "You that, sometimes known, oftener unknown, really shape and mould the New World,",
  "    adjusting",
  "  it to Time and Space,",

  "",
  "The falling trunk and limbs, the crash, the muffled shriek, the groan,",
  "Such words combined from the Redwood-tree—as of wood-spirits’ voices ecstatic, ancient and",
  "  rustling,",
  "The century-lasting, unseen dryads, singing, withdrawing,",
  "All their recesses of forests and mountains leaving,",
  "From the Cascade range to the Wasatch—or Idaho far, or Utah,",

  "The flashing and golden pageant of California!",
  "The sudden and gorgeous drama—the sunny and ample lands;",
