  "Came furrowing all the orient into gold.",
  "We rose, and each by other drest with care",

  "In shadow, but the Muses' heads were touched",
  "Above the darkness from their native East.",
  "",
  "There while we stood beside the fount, and watched",
  "Or seemed to watch the dancing bubble, approached",
  "Melissa, tinged with wan from lack of sleep,",
  "Or grief, and glowing round her dewy eyes",
  "The circled Iris of a night of tears;",

  "My mother knows:' and when I asked her 'how,'",
  "'My fault' she wept 'my fault! and yet not mine;",
  "Yet mine in part. O hear me, pardon me.",
  "My mother, 'tis her wont from night to night",
  "To rail at Lady Psyche and her side.",
  "She says the Princess should have been the Head,",
  "Herself and Lady Psyche the two arms;",
  "And so it was agreed when first they came;",
  "But Lady Psyche was the right hand now,",
  "And the left, or not, or seldom used;",
  "Hers more than half the students, all the love.",
  "And so last night she fell to canvass you:",
  "~Her~ countrywomen! she did not envy her.",
  "\"Who ever saw such wild barbarians?",
  "Girls?--more like men!\" and at these words the snake,",
  "My secret, seemed to stir within my breast;",
  "And oh, Sirs, could I help it, but my cheek",
  "Began to burn and burn, and her lynx eye",
  "To fix and make me hotter, till she laughed:",
  "\"O marvellously modest maiden, you!",
  "Men! girls, like men! why, if they had been men",
  "You need not set your thoughts in rubric thus",
  "For wholesale comment.\" Pardon, I am shamed",
  "That I must needs repeat for my excuse",
  "What looks so little graceful: \"men\" (for still",
  "My mother went revolving on the word)",
  "\"And so they are,--very like men indeed--",
  "And with that woman closeted for hours!\"",
  "Then came these dreadful words out one by one,",
  "\"Why--these--~are~--men:\" I shuddered: \"and you know it.\"",
  "\"O ask me nothing,\" I said: \"And she knows too,",
  "And she conceals it.\" So my mother clutched",
  "The truth at once, but with no word from me;",
  "And now thus early risen she goes to inform",
  "The Princess: Lady Psyche will be crushed;",
  "But you may yet be saved, and therefore fly;",
  "But heal me with your pardon ere you go.'",
  "",
  "'What pardon, sweet Melissa, for a blush?'",
  "Said Cyril: 'Pale one, blush again: than wear",
  "Those lilies, better blush our lives away.",
  "Yet let us breathe for one hour more in Heaven'",
  "He added, 'lest some classic Angel speak",
  "In scorn of us, \"They mounted, Ganymedes,",
  "To tumble, Vulcans, on the second morn.\"",
  "But I will melt this marble into wax",
  "To yield us farther furlough:' and he went.",
  "",
  "Melissa shook her doubtful curls, and thought",
  "He scarce would prosper. 'Tell us,' Florian asked,",
  "'How grew this feud betwixt the right and left.'",
  "'O long ago,' she said, 'betwixt these two",
  "Division smoulders hidden; 'tis my mother,",
  "Too jealous, often fretful as the wind",
  "Pent in a crevice: much I bear with her:",
  "I never knew my father, but she says",
  "(God help her) she was wedded to a fool;",
  "And still she railed against the state of things.",
  "She had the care of Lady Ida's youth,",
  "And from the Queen's decease she brought her up.",
  "But when your sister came she won the heart",
  "Of Ida: they were still together, grew",
  "(For so they said themselves) inosculated;",
  "Consonant chords that shiver to one note;",
  "One mind in all things: yet my mother still",
  "Affirms your Psyche thieved her theories,",
  "And angled with them for her pupil's love:",
  "She calls her plagiarist; I know not what:",
  "But I must go: I dare not tarry,' and light,",
  "As flies the shadow of a bird, she fled.",
  "",
  "Then murmured Florian gazing after her,",
  "'An open-hearted maiden, true and pure.",
  "If I could love, why this were she: how pretty",
  "Her blushing was, and how she blushed again,",
  "As if to close with Cyril's random wish:",
  "Not like your Princess crammed with erring pride,",
  "Nor like poor Psyche whom she drags in tow.'",
  "",
  "'The crane,' I said, 'may chatter of the crane,",
  "The dove may murmur of the dove, but I",
  "An eagle clang an eagle to the sphere.",
  "My princess, O my princess! true she errs,",
  "But in her own grand way: being herself",
  "Three times more noble than three score of men,",
  "She sees herself in every woman else,",
  "And so she wears her error like a crown",
  "To blind the truth and me: for her, and her,",
  "Hebes are they to hand ambrosia, mix",
  "The nectar; but--ah she--whene'er she moves",
  "The Samian Her√® rises and she speaks",
  "A Memnon smitten with the morning Sun.'",
  "",
  "So saying from the court we paced, and gained",
  "The terrace ranged along the Northern front,",
  "And leaning there on those balusters, high",
  "Above the empurpled champaign, drank the gale",
  "That blown about the foliage underneath,",
  "And sated with the innumerable rose,",
  "Beat balm upon our eyelids. Hither came",
  "Cyril, and yawning 'O hard task,' he cried;",
  "'No fighting shadows here! I forced a way",
  "Through opposition crabbed and gnarled.",
  "Better to clear prime forests, heave and thump",
  "A league of street in summer solstice down,",
  "Than hammer at this reverend gentlewoman.",
  "I knocked and, bidden, entered; found her there",
  "At point to move, and settled in her eyes",
  "The green malignant light of coming storm.",
  "Sir, I was courteous, every phrase well-oiled,",
  "As man's could be; yet maiden-meek I prayed",
  "Concealment: she demanded who we were,",
  "And why we came? I fabled nothing fair,",
  "But, your example pilot, told her all.",
  "Up went the hushed amaze of hand and eye.",
  "But when I dwelt upon your old affiance,",
  "She answered sharply that I talked astray.",
  "I urged the fierce inscription on the gate,",
  "And our three lives. True--we had limed ourselves",
  "With open eyes, and we must take the chance.",
  "But such extremes, I told her, well might harm",
  "The woman's cause. \"Not more than now,\" she said,",
  "\"So puddled as it is with favouritism.\"",
  "I tried the mother's heart. Shame might befall",
  "Melissa, knowing, saying not she knew:",
  "Her answer was \"Leave me to deal with that.\"",
  "I spoke of war to come and many deaths,",
  "And she replied, her duty was to speak,",
  "And duty duty, clear of consequences.",
  "I grew discouraged, Sir; but since I knew",
  "No rock so hard but that a little wave",
  "May beat admission in a thousand years,",
  "I recommenced; \"Decide not ere you pause.",
  "I find you here but in the second place,",
  "Some say the third--the authentic foundress you.",
  "I offer boldly: we will seat you highest:",
  "Wink at our advent: help my prince to gain",
  "His rightful bride, and here I promise you",
  "Some palace in our land, where you shall reign",
  "The head and heart of all our fair she-world,",
  "And your great name flow on with broadening time",
  "For ever.\" Well, she balanced this a little,",
  "And told me she would answer us today,",

  "",
  "He ceasing, came a message from the Head.",
  "'That afternoon the Princess rode to take",
  "The dip of certain strata to the North.",
  "Would we go with her? we should find the land",
  "Worth seeing; and the river made a fall",
  "Out yonder:' then she pointed on to where",
  "A double hill ran up his furrowy forks",
  "Beyond the thick-leaved platans of the vale.",
  "",
  "Agreed to, this, the day fled on through all",
  "Its range of duties to the appointed hour.",
  "Then summoned to the porch we went. She stood",
  "Among her maidens, higher by the head,",
  "Her back against a pillar, her foot on one",
  "Of those tame leopards. Kittenlike he rolled",
  "And pawed about her sandal. I drew near;",
  "I gazed. On a sudden my strange seizure came",
  "Upon me, the weird vision of our house:",
  "The Princess Ida seemed a hollow show,",
  "Her gay-furred cats a painted fantasy,",
  "Her college and her maidens, empty masks,",
  "And I myself the shadow of a dream,",
  "For all things were and were not. Yet I felt",
  "My heart beat thick with passion and with awe;",
  "Then from my breast the involuntary sigh",
  "Brake, as she smote me with the light of eyes",
  "That lent my knee desire to kneel, and shook",
  "My pulses, till to horse we got, and so",
  "Went forth in long retinue following up",
  "The river as it narrowed to the hills.",
  "",
  "I rode beside her and to me she said:",
  "'O friend, we trust that you esteemed us not",
  "Too harsh to your companion yestermorn;",
  "Unwillingly we spake.' 'No--not to her,'",
  "I answered, 'but to one of whom we spake",
  "Your Highness might have seemed the thing you say.'",
  "'Again?' she cried, 'are you ambassadresses",
  "From him to me? we give you, being strange,",
  "A license: speak, and let the topic die.'",
  "",
  "I stammered that I knew him--could have wished--",
  "'Our king expects--was there no precontract?",
  "There is no truer-hearted--ah, you seem",
  "All he prefigured, and he could not see",
  "The bird of passage flying south but longed",
  "To follow: surely, if your Highness keep",
  "Your purport, you will shock him even to death,",
  "Or baser courses, children of despair.'",
  "",
  "'Poor boy,' she said, 'can he not read--no books?",
  "Quoit, tennis, ball--no games? nor deals in that",
  "Which men delight in, martial exercise?",
  "To nurse a blind ideal like a girl,",
  "Methinks he seems no better than a girl;",
  "As girls were once, as we ourself have been:",
  "We had our dreams; perhaps he mixt with them:",
  "We touch on our dead self, nor shun to do it,",
  "Being other--since we learnt our meaning here,",
  "To lift the woman's fallen divinity",
  "Upon an even pedestal with man.'",
  "",
  "She paused, and added with a haughtier smile",
  "'And as to precontracts, we move, my friend,",
  "At no man's beck, but know ourself and thee,",
  "O Vashti, noble Vashti! Summoned out",
  "She kept her state, and left the drunken king",
  "To brawl at Shushan underneath the palms.'",
  "",
  "'Alas your Highness breathes full East,' I said,",
  "'On that which leans to you. I know the Prince,",
  "I prize his truth: and then how vast a work",
  "To assail this gray pre√´minence of man!",
  "You grant me license; might I use it? think;",
  "Ere half be done perchance your life may fail;",
  "Then comes the feebler heiress of your plan,",
  "And takes and ruins all; and thus your pains",
  "May only make that footprint upon sand",
  "Which old-recurring waves of prejudice",
  "Resmooth to nothing: might I dread that you,",
  "With only Fame for spouse and your great deeds",
  "For issue, yet may live in vain, and miss,",
  "Meanwhile, what every woman counts her due,",
  "Love, children, happiness?'",
  "And she exclaimed,",
  "'Peace, you young savage of the Northern wild!",
  "What! though your Prince's love were like a God's,",

  "You are bold indeed: we are not talked to thus:",

  "And she broke out interpreting my thoughts:",

  "'No doubt we seem a kind of monster to you;",

  "Dabbling a shameless hand with shameful jest,",
  "Encarnalize their spirits: yet we know",
  "Knowledge is knowledge, and this matter hangs:",
  "Howbeit ourself, foreseeing casualty,",
  "Nor willing men should come among us, learnt,",
