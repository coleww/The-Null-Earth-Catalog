  "  DEAR MURRAY,--",
  "          You ask for a \"_Volume of Nonsense_,\"",
  "  Have all of your authors exhausted their store?",
  "I thought you had published a good deal not long since.",
  "  And doubtless the Squadron are ready with more.",
  "But on looking again, I perceive that the Species",
  "Of \"Nonsense\" you want must be purely \"_facetious_;\"",
  "And, as that is the case, you had best put to press",
  "  Mr. Sotheby's tragedies now in M.S.,",
  "            Some Syrian Sally",
  "            From common-place Gally,",
  "Or, if you prefer the bookmaking of women,",
  "Take a spick and span \"Sketch\" of your feminine _He-Man_.",
