  "'Twas now the hour when Night had driven",
  "Her car half round yon sable heaven;",
  "Bo√∂tes, only, seem'd to roll",
  "His Arctic charge around the Pole;",
  "While mortals, lost in gentle sleep,",
  "Forgot to smile, or ceas'd to weep:",
  "At this lone hour the Paphian boy,",
  "Descending from the realms of joy,",
  "Quick to my gate directs his course,",
  "And knocks with all his little force;",
  "My visions fled, alarm'd I rose,--",
  "\"What stranger breaks my blest repose?\"",
  "\"Alas!\" replies the wily child",
  "In faltering accents sweetly mild;",
  "\"A hapless Infant here I roam,",
  "Far from my dear maternal home.",
  "Oh! shield me from the wintry blast!",
  "The nightly storm is pouring fast.",
  "No prowling robber lingers here;",
  "A wandering baby who can fear?\"",
  "I heard his seeming artless tale,",
  "I heard his sighs upon the gale:",
  "My breast was never pity's foe,",
  "But felt for all the baby's woe.",
  "I drew the bar, and by the light",
  "Young Love, the infant, met my sight;",
  "His bow across his shoulders flung,",
  "And thence his fatal quiver hung",
  "(Ah! little did I think the dart",
  "Would rankle soon within my heart).",
  "With care I tend my weary guest,",
  "His little fingers chill my breast;",
  "His glossy curls, his azure wing,",
  "Which droop with nightly showers, I wring;",
  "His shivering limbs the embers warm;",
  "And now reviving from the storm,",
  "Scarce had he felt his wonted glow,",
  "Than swift he seized his slender bow:--",
  "\"I fain would know, my gentle host,\"",
  "He cried, \"if this its strength has lost;",
  "I fear, relax'd with midnight dews,",
  "The strings their former aid refuse.\"",
  "With poison tipt, his arrow flies,",
  "Deep in my tortur'd heart it lies:",
  "Then loud the joyous Urchin laugh'd:--",
  "\"My bow can still impel the shaft:",
  "'Tis firmly fix'd, thy sighs reveal it;",
  "Say, courteous host, canst thou not feel it?\"",
