  "I had a dream, which was not all a dream.",
  "The bright sun was extinguished, and the stars",
  "Did wander darkling in the eternal space,",
  "Rayless, and pathless, and the icy Earth",
  "Swung blind and blackening in the moonless air;",
  "Morn came and went--and came, and brought no day,",
  "And men forgot their passions in the dread",
  "Of this their desolation; and all hearts",
  "Were chilled into a selfish prayer for light:",
  "And they did live by watchfires--and the thrones,",
  "The palaces of crownéd kings--the huts,",
  "The habitations of all things which dwell,",
  "Were burnt for beacons; cities were consumed,",
  "And men were gathered round their blazing homes",
  "To look once more into each other's face;",
  "Happy were those who dwelt within the eye",
  "Of the volcanos, and their mountain-torch:",
  "A fearful hope was all the World contained;",
  "Forests were set on fire--but hour by hour",
  "They fell and faded--and the crackling trunks",
  "Extinguished with a crash--and all was black.",
  "The brows of men by the despairing light",
  "Wore an unearthly aspect, as by fits",
  "The flashes fell upon them; some lay down",
  "And hid their eyes and wept; and some did rest",
  "Their chins upon their clenchéd hands, and smiled;",
  "And others hurried to and fro, and fed",
  "Their funeral piles with fuel, and looked up",
  "With mad disquietude on the dull sky,",
  "The pall of a past World; and then again",
  "With curses cast them down upon the dust,",
  "And gnashed their teeth and howled: the wild birds shrieked,",
  "And, terrified, did flutter on the ground,",
  "And flap their useless wings; the wildest brutes",
  "Came tame and tremulous; and vipers crawled",
  "And twined themselves among the multitude,",
  "Hissing, but stingless--they were slain for food:",
  "And War, which for a moment was no more,",
  "Did glut himself again:--a meal was bought",
  "With blood, and each sate sullenly apart",
  "Gorging himself in gloom: no Love was left;",
  "All earth was but one thought--and that was Death,",
  "Immediate and inglorious; and the pang",
  "Of famine fed upon all entrails--men",
  "Died, and their bones were tombless as their flesh;",
  "The meagre by the meagre were devoured,",
  "Even dogs assailed their masters, all save one,",
  "And he was faithful to a corse, and kept",
  "The birds and beasts and famished men at bay,",
  "Till hunger clung them, or the dropping dead",
  "Lured their lank jaws; himself sought out no food,",
  "But with a piteous and perpetual moan,",
  "And a quick desolate cry, licking the hand",
  "Which answered not with a caress--he died.",
  "The crowd was famished by degrees; but two",
  "Of an enormous city did survive,",
  "And they were enemies: they met beside",
  "The dying embers of an altar-place",
  "Where had been heaped a mass of holy things",
  "For an unholy usage; they raked up,",
  "And shivering scraped with their cold skeleton hands",
  "The feeble ashes, and their feeble breath",
  "Blew for a little life, and made a flame",
  "Which was a mockery; then they lifted up",
  "Their eyes as it grew lighter, and beheld",
  "Each other's aspects--saw, and shrieked, and died--",
  "Even of their mutual hideousness they died,",
  "Unknowing who he was upon whose brow",
  "Famine had written Fiend. The World was void,",
  "The populous and the powerful was a lump,",
  "Seasonless, herbless, treeless, manless, lifeless--",
  "A lump of death--a chaos of hard clay.",
  "The rivers, lakes, and ocean all stood still,",
  "And nothing stirred within their silent depths;",
  "Ships sailorless lay rotting on the sea,",
  "And their masts fell down piecemeal: as they dropped",
  "They slept on the abyss without a surge--",
  "The waves were dead; the tides were in their grave,",
  "The Moon, their mistress, had expired before;",
  "The winds were withered in the stagnant air,",
  "And the clouds perished; Darkness had no need",
  "Of aid from them--She was the Universe.",
