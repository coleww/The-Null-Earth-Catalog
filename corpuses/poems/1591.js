  "Of that sort of Dramatic Poem which is call'd Tragedy.",
  "",
  "",
  "TRAGEDY, as it was antiently compos'd, hath been ever held the",
  "gravest, moralest, and most profitable of all other Poems:",
  "therefore said by Aristotle to be of power by raising pity and fear,",
  "or terror, to purge the mind of those and such like passions, that is",
  "to temper and reduce them to just measure with a kind of delight,",
  "stirr'd up by reading or seeing those passions well imitated. Nor is",
  "Nature wanting in her own effects to make good his assertion: for",
  "so in Physic things of melancholic hue and quality are us'd against",
  "melancholy, sowr against sowr, salt to remove salt humours.",
  "Hence Philosophers and other gravest Writers, as Cicero, Plutarch",
  "and others, frequently cite out of Tragic Poets, both to adorn and",
  "illustrate thir discourse.  The Apostle Paul himself thought it not",
  "unworthy to insert a verse of Euripides into the Text of Holy",
  "Scripture, I Cor. 15. 33. and Paraeus commenting on the",
  "Revelation, divides the whole Book as a Tragedy, into Acts",
  "distinguisht each by a Chorus of Heavenly Harpings and Song",
  "between.  Heretofore Men in highest dignity have labour'd not a",
  "little to be thought able to compose a Tragedy.  Of that honour",
  "Dionysius the elder was no less ambitious, then before of his",
  "attaining to the Tyranny. Augustus Caesar also had begun his",
  "Ajax, but unable to please his own judgment with what he had",
  "begun. left it unfinisht.  Seneca the Philosopher is by some thought",
  "the Author of those Tragedies (at lest the best of them) that go",
  "under that name.  Gregory Nazianzen a Father of the Church,",
  "thought it not unbeseeming the sanctity of his person to write a",
  "Tragedy which he entitl'd, Christ suffering. This is mention'd to",
  "vindicate Tragedy from the small esteem, or rather infamy, which",
  "in the account of many it undergoes at this day with other common",
  "Interludes; hap'ning through the Poets error of intermixing Comic",
  "stuff with Tragic sadness and gravity; or introducing trivial and",
  "vulgar persons, which by all judicious hath bin counted absurd; and",
  "brought in without discretion, corruptly to gratifie the people. And",
  "though antient Tragedy use no Prologue, yet using sometimes, in",
  "case of self defence, or explanation, that which Martial calls an",
  "Epistle; in behalf of this Tragedy coming forth after the antient",
  "manner, much different from what among us passes for best, thus",
  "much before-hand may be Epistl'd; that Chorus is here introduc'd",
  "after the Greek manner, not antient only but modern, and still in",
  "use among the Italians. In the modelling therefore of this Poem",
  "with good reason, the Antients and Italians are rather follow'd, as",
  "of much more authority and fame. The measure of Verse us'd in",
  "the Chorus is of all sorts, call'd by the Greeks Monostrophic, or",
  "rather Apolelymenon, without regard had to Strophe, Antistrophe",
  "or Epod, which were a kind of Stanza's fram'd only for the Music,",
  "then us'd with the Chorus that sung; not essential to the Poem, and",
  "therefore not material; or being divided into Stanza's or Pauses",
  "they may be call'd Allaeostropha.  Division into Act and Scene",
  "referring chiefly to the Stage (to which this work never was",
  "intended) is here omitted.",
  "",
  " It suffices if the whole Drama be found not produc't beyond the",
  "fift Act, of the style and uniformitie, and that commonly call'd the",
  "Plot, whether intricate or explicit, which is nothing indeed but such",
  "oeconomy, or disposition of the fable as may stand best with",
  "verisimilitude and decorum; they only will best judge who are not",
  "unacquainted with Aeschulus, Sophocles, and Euripides, the three",
  "Tragic Poets unequall'd yet by any, and the best rule to all who",
  "endeavour to write Tragedy. The circumscription of time wherein",
  "the whole Drama begins and ends, is according to antient rule, and",
  "best example, within the space of 24 hours.",
