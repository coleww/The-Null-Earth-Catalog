  "SILENUS:",
  "O Bacchus, what a world of toil, both now",
  "And ere these limbs were overworn with age,",
  "Have I endured for thee! First, when thou fled'st",
  "The mountain-nymphs who nursed thee, driven afar",
  "By the strange madness Juno sent upon thee;",
  "Then in the battle of the Sons of Earth,",
  "When I stood foot by foot close to thy side,",
  "No unpropitious fellow-combatant,",
  "And, driving through his shield my winged spear,",
  "Slew vast Enceladus. Consider now,",
  "Is it a dream of which I speak to thee?",
  "By Jove it is not, for you have the trophies!",
  "And now I suffer more than all before.",
  "For when I heard that Juno had devised",
  "A tedious voyage for you, I put to sea",
  "With all my children quaint in search of you,",
  "And I myself stood on the beaked prow",
  "And fixed the naked mast; and all my boys",
  "Leaning upon their oars, with splash and strain",
  "Made white with foam the green and purple sea,--",
  "And so we sought you, king. We were sailing",
  "Near Malea, when an eastern wind arose,",
  "And drove us to this waste Aetnean rock;",
  "The one-eyed children of the Ocean God,",
  "The man-destroying Cyclopses, inhabit,",
  "On this wild shore, their solitary caves,",
  "And one of these, named Polypheme. has caught us",
  "To be his slaves; and so, for all delight",
  "Of Bacchic sports, sweet dance and melody,",
  "We keep this lawless giant's wandering flocks.",
  "My sons indeed on far declivities,",
  "Young things themselves, tend on the youngling sheep,",
  "But I remain to fill the water-casks,",
  "Or sweeping the hard floor, or ministering",
  "Some impious and abominable meal",
  "To the fell Cyclops. I am wearied of it!",
  "And now I must scrape up the littered floor",
  "With this great iron rake, so to receive",
  "My absent master and his evening sheep",
  "In a cave neat and clean. Even now I see",
  "My children tending the flocks hitherward.",
  "Ha! what is this? are your Sicinnian measures",
  "Even now the same, as when with dance and song",
  "You brought young Bacchus to Althaea's halls?",
  "",
  "CHORUS OF SATYRS:",
  "",
  "STROPHE:",
  "Where has he of race divine",
  "Wandered in the winding rocks?",
  "Here the air is calm and fine",
  "For the father of the flocks;--",
  "Here the grass is soft and sweet,",
  "And the river-eddies meet",
  "In the trough beside the cave,",
  "Bright as in their fountain wave.--",
  "Neither here, nor on the dew",
  "Of the lawny uplands feeding?",
  "Oh, you come!--a stone at you",
  "Will I throw to mend your breeding;--",
  "Get along, you horned thing,",
  "Wild, seditious, rambling!",
  "",
  "EPODE:",
  "An Iacchic melody",

  "Bacchus, O beloved, where,",
  "Shaking wide thy yellow hair,",
  "Wanderest thou alone, afar?",
  "To the one-eyed Cyclops, we,",
  "Who by right thy servants are,",
  "Minister in misery,",
  "In these wretched goat-skins clad,",
  "Far from thy delights and thee.",
  "",
  "SILENUS:",
  "Be silent, sons; command the slaves to drive",
  "The gathered flocks into the rock-roofed cave.",
  "",
  "CHORUS:",
  "Go! But what needs this serious haste, O father?",
  "",
  "SILENUS:",
  "I see a Grecian vessel on the coast,",
  "And thence the rowers with some general",
  "Approaching to this cave.--About their necks",
  "Hang empty vessels, as they wanted food,",
  "And water-flasks.--Oh, miserable strangers!",
  "Whence come they, that they know not what and who",
  "My master is, approaching in ill hour",
  "The inhospitable roof of Polypheme,",
  "And the Cyclopian jaw-bone, man-destroying?",
  "Be silent, Satyrs, while I ask and hear",
  "Whence coming, they arrive the Aetnean hill.",
  "",
  "ULYSSES:",
  "Friends, can you show me some clear water-spring,",
  "The remedy of our thirst? Will any one",
  "Furnish with food seamen in want of it?",
  "Ha! what is this? We seem to be arrived",
  "At the blithe court of Bacchus. I observe",
  "This sportive band of Satyrs near the caves.",

  "I am the same, but do not rail upon me.--",
  "",
  "SILENUS:",
  "Whence sailing do you come to Sicily?",
  "",
  "ULYSSES:",
  "From Ilion, and from the Trojan toils.",
  "",
  "SILENUS:",
  "How, touched you not at your paternal shore?",
  "",
  "ULYSSES:",
  "The strength of tempests bore me here by force.",
  "",
  "SILENUS:",
  "The self-same accident occurred to me.",
  "",
  "ULYSSES:",
  "Were you then driven here by stress of weather?",
  "",
  "SILENUS:",
  "Following the Pirates who had kidnapped Bacchus.",
  "",
  "ULYSSES:",
  "What land is this, and who inhabit it?--",
  "",
  "SILENUS:",
  "Aetna, the loftiest peak in Sicily.",
  "",
  "ULYSSES:",
  "And are there walls, and tower-surrounded towns?",
  "",
  "SILENUS:",
  "There are not.--These lone rocks are bare of men.",
  "",
  "ULYSSES:",
  "And who possess the land? the race of beasts?",
  "",

  "Have they the Bromian drink from the vine's stream?",
  "",
  "SILENUS:",
  "Ah! no; they live in an ungracious land.",
  "",
  "ULYSSES:",
  "And are they just to strangers?--hospitable?",
  "",
  "SILENUS:",
  "They think the sweetest thing a stranger brings",
  "Is his own flesh.",
  "",
  "ULYSSES:",
  "What! do they eat man's flesh?",
  "",
  "SILENUS:",
  "No one comes here who is not eaten up.",

  "",
  "ULYSSES:",
  "Provide us food, of which we are in want.",
  "",
  "SILENUS:",
  "Here is not anything, as I said, but meat.",
  "",
  "ULYSSES:",
  "But meat is a sweet remedy for hunger.",
  "",
  "SILENUS:",
  "Cow's milk there is, and store of curdled cheese.",

  "ULYSSES:",
  "Old man, this skin contains it, which you see.",
  "",
  "SILENUS:",
  "Why, this would hardly be a mouthful for me.",
  "",
  "ULYSSES:",
  "Nay, twice as much as you can draw from thence.",
  "",
  "SILENUS:",
  "You speak of a fair fountain, sweet to me.",
  "",
  "ULYSSES:",
  "Would you first taste of the unmingled wine?",
  "",
  "SILENUS:",
  "'Tis just--tasting invites the purchaser.",
  "",
  "ULYSSES:",
  "Here is the cup, together with the skin.",
  "",
  "SILENUS:",
  "Pour: that the draught may fillip my remembrance.",
  "",
  "ULYSSES:",
  "See!",
  "",
  "SILENUS:",
  "Papaiapax! what a sweet smell it has!",
  "",
  "ULYSSES:",
  "You see it then?--",
  "",
  "SILENUS:",
  "By Jove, no! but I smell it.",
  "",
  "ULYSSES:",
  "Taste, that you may not praise it in words only.",
  "",
  "SILENUS:",
  "Babai! Great Bacchus calls me forth to dance!",
  "Joy! joy!",
  "",
  "ULYSSES:",
  "Did it flow sweetly down your throat?",
  "",
  "SILENUS:",
  "So that it tingled to my very nails.",

  "ULYSSES:",
  "And in addition I will give you gold.",
  "",
  "SILENUS:",
  "Let gold alone! only unlock the cask.",
  "",
  "ULYSSES:",
  "Bring out some cheeses now, or a young goat.",
  "",
  "SILENUS:",
  "That will I do, despising any master.",
  "Yes, let me drink one cup, and I will give",
  "All that the Cyclops feed upon their mountains.",
  "",
  "...",

  "CHORUS:",

  "",
  "ULYSSES:",
  "And utterly destroyed the race of Priam.",

  "...",
  "",
  "SILENUS:",
  "The wanton wretch! she was bewitched to see",
  "The many-coloured anklets and the chain",
  "Of woven gold which girt the neck of Paris,",
  "And so she left that good man Menelaus.",
  "There should be no more women in the world",
  "But such as are reserved for me alone.--",
  "See, here are sheep, and here are goats, Ulysses,",
  "Here are unsparing cheeses of pressed milk;",

  "First leaving my reward, the Bacchic dew",
  "Of joy-inspiring grapes.",
  "",
  "ULYSSES:",
  "Ah me! Alas!",
  "What shall we do? the Cyclops is at hand!",
  "Old man, we perish! whither can we fly?",

  "SILENUS:",
  "The cavern has recesses numberless;",
  "Hide yourselves quick.",
  "",
  "ULYSSES:",
  "That will I never do!",
  "The mighty Troy would be indeed disgraced",
  "If I should fly one man. How many times",
  "Have I withstood, with shield immovable.",
  "Ten thousand Phrygians!--if I needs must die,",

  "",
  "SILENUS:",
  "O'er-brimming;",
  "So you may drink a tunful if you will.",

  "CYCLOPS:",
  "Is it ewe's milk or cow's milk, or both mixed?--",
  "",
  "SILENUS:",
  "Both, either; only pray don't swallow me.",
  "",
  "CYCLOPS:",
  "By no means.--",
  "...",
  "What is this crowd I see beside the stalls?",
  "Outlaws or thieves? for near my cavern-home",
  "I see my young lambs coupled two by two",
  "With willow bands; mixed with my cheeses lie",
  "Their implements; and this old fellow here",
  "Has his bald head broken with stripes.",
  "",
  "SILENUS:",
  "Ah me!",
  "I have been beaten till I burn with fever.",
  "",
  "CYCLOPS:",
  "By whom? Who laid his fist upon your head?",
  "",
  "SILENUS:",
  "Those men, because I would not suffer them",
  "To steal your goods.",
  "",
  "CYCLOPS:",
  "Did not the rascals know",
  "I am a God, sprung from the race of Heaven?",
  "",
  "SILENUS:",
  "I told them so, but they bore off your things,",
  "And ate the cheese in spite of all I said,",
  "And carried out the lambs--and said, moreover,",
  "They'd pin you down with a three-cubit collar,",
  "And pull your vitals out through your one eye,",
  "Furrow your back with stripes, then, binding you,",
  "Throw you as ballast into the ship's hold,",
  "And then deliver you, a slave, to move",
  "Enormous rocks, or found a vestibule.",
  "",
  "CYCLOPS:",
  "In truth? Nay, haste, and place in order quickly",
  "The cooking-knives, and heap upon the hearth,",
  "And kindle it, a great faggot of wood.--",
  "As soon as they are slaughtered, they shall fill",
  "My belly, broiling warm from the live coals,",
  "Or boiled and seethed within the bubbling caldron.",
  "I am quite sick of the wild mountain game;",
  "Of stags and lions I have gorged enough,",

  "",
  "SILENUS:",
  "Nay, master, something new is very pleasant",
  "After one thing forever, and of late",
  "Very few strangers have approached our cave.",
  "",
  "ULYSSES:",
  "Hear, Cyclops, a plain tale on the other side.",
  "We, wanting to buy food, came from our ship",
  "Into the neighbourhood of your cave, and here",
  "This old Silenus gave us in exchange",
  "These lambs for wine, the which he took and drank,",
  "And all by mutual compact, without force.",
  "There is no word of truth in what he says,",
  "For slyly he was selling all your store.",

  "If I speak false, then may my father perish,",
  "But do not thou wrong hospitality.",
  "",
  "CYCLOPS:",
  "You lie! I swear that he is juster far",
  "Than Rhadamanthus--I trust more in him.",
  "But let me ask, whence have ye sailed, O strangers?",
  "Who are you? And what city nourished ye?",
  "",
  "ULYSSES:",
  "Our race is Ithacan--having destroyed",
  "The town of Troy, the tempests of the sea",
  "Have driven us on thy land, O Polypheme.",
  "",

  "But, O great Offspring of the Ocean-King,",

  "That thou dost spare thy friends who visit thee,",
  "And place no impious food within thy jaws.",
  "For in the depths of Greece we have upreared",
  "Temples to thy great Father, which are all",
  "His homes. The sacred bay of Taenarus",
  "Remains inviolate, and each dim recess",
  "Scooped high on the Malean promontory,",
  "And aery Sunium's silver-veined crag,",
  "Which divine Pallas keeps unprofaned ever,",
  "The Gerastian asylums, and whate'er",
  "Within wide Greece our enterprise has kept",
  "From Phrygian contumely; and in which",
  "You have a common care, for you inhabit",
  "The skirts of Grecian land, under the roots",
  "Of Aetna and its crags, spotted with fire.",
  "Turn then to converse under human laws,",
  "Receive us shipwrecked suppliants, and provide",
  "Food, clothes, and fire, and hospitable gifts;",
  "Nor fixing upon oxen-piercing spits",
  "Our limbs, so fill your belly and your jaws.",
  "Priam's wide land has widowed Greece enough;",
  "And weapon-winged murder leaped together",
  "Enough of dead, and wives are husbandless,",
  "And ancient women and gray fathers wail",
  "Their childless age;--if you should roast the rest--",
  "And 'tis a bitter feast that you prepare--",
  "Where then would any turn? Yet be persuaded;",
  "Forgo the lust of your jaw-bone; prefer",
  "Pious humanity to wicked will:",
  "Many have bought too dear their evil joys.",
  "",
  "SILENUS:",
  "Let me advise you, do not spare a morsel",
  "Of all his flesh. If you should eat his tongue",
  "You would become most eloquent, O Cyclops.",
  "",
  "CYCLOPS:",
  "Wealth, my good fellow, is the wise man's God,",

  "The sacred rocks whereon he dwells, to me?",
  "Stranger, I laugh to scorn Jove's thunderbolt,",
  "I know not that his strength is more than mine.",
  "As to the rest I care not.--When he pours",
  "Rain from above, I have a close pavilion",
  "Under this rock, in which I lie supine,",
  "Feasting on a roast calf or some wild beast,",
  "And drinking pans of milk, and gloriously",
  "Emulating the thunder of high Heaven.",
  "And when the Thracian wind pours down the snow,",
  "I wrap my body in the skins of beasts,",
  "Kindle a fire, and bid the snow whirl on.",
  "The earth, by force, whether it will or no,",
  "Bringing forth grass, fattens my flocks and herds,",

  "You may chop it, and tear it, and gnash it for fun,",
  "An hairy goat's-skin contains the whole.",
  "Let me but escape, and ferry me o'er",
  "The stream of your wrath to a safer shore.",
  "The Cyclops Aetnean is cruel and bold,",
  "He murders the strangers",
  "That sit on his hearth,",
  "And dreads no avengers",
  "To rise from the earth.",
  "He roasts the men before they are cold,",
  "He snatches them broiling from the coal,",
  "And from the caldron pulls them whole,",

  "CHORUS:",
  "Unhappy man!",
  "",
  "...",
  "",
  "ULYSSES:",
  "Soon as we came into this craggy place,",
  "Kindling a fire, he cast on the broad hearth",
  "The knotty limbs of an enormous oak,",
  "Three waggon-loads at least, and then he strewed",
  "Upon the ground, beside the red firelight,",
  "His couch of pine-leaves; and he milked the cows,",
  "And pouring forth the white milk, filled a bowl",
  "Three cubits wide and four in depth, as much",
  "As would contain ten amphorae, and bound it",
  "With ivy wreaths; then placed upon the fire",
  "A brazen pot to boil, and made red hot",
  "The points of spits, not sharpened with the sickle",
  "But with a fruit tree bough, and with the jaws",
  "Of axes for Aetnean slaughterings.",
  "And when this God-abandoned Cook of Hell",
  "Had made all ready, he seized two of us",
  "And killed them in a kind of measured manner;",
  "For he flung one against the brazen rivets",
  "Of the huge caldron, and seized the other",
  "By the foot's tendon, and knocked out his brains",
  "Upon the sharp edge of the craggy stone:",
  "Then peeled his flesh with a great cooking-knife",
  "And put him down to roast. The other's limbs",
  "He chopped into the caldron to be boiled.",
  "And I, with the tears raining from my eyes,",
  "Stood near the Cyclops, ministering to him;",
  "The rest, in the recesses of the cave,",
  "Clung to the rock like bats, bloodless with fear.",
  "When he was filled with my companions' flesh,",
  "He threw himself upon the ground and sent",
  "A loathsome exhalation from his maw.",
  "Then a divine thought came to me. I filled",
  "The cup of Maron, and I offered him",
  "To taste, and said:--'Child of the Ocean God,",
  "Behold what drink the vines of Greece produce,",
  "The exultation and the joy of Bacchus.'",
  "He, satiated with his unnatural food,",
  "Received it, and at one draught drank it off,",
  "And taking my hand, praised me:--'Thou hast given",
  "A sweet draught after a sweet meal, dear guest.'",
  "And I, perceiving that it pleased him, filled",
  "Another cup, well knowing that the wine",
  "Would wound him soon and take a sure revenge.",
  "And the charm fascinated him, and I",
  "Plied him cup after cup, until the drink",
  "Had warmed his entrails, and he sang aloud",
  "In concert with my wailing fellow-seamen",
  "A hideous discord--and the cavern rung.",
  "I have stolen out, so that if you will",
  "You may achieve my safety and your own.",
  "But say, do you desire, or not, to fly",
  "This uncompanionable man, and dwell",
  "As was your wont among the Grecian Nymphs",
  "Within the fanes of your beloved God?",
  "Your father there within agrees to it,",
  "But he is weak and overcome with wine,",
  "And caught as if with bird-lime by the cup,",
  "He claps his wings and crows in doting joy.",
  "You who are young escape with me, and find",
  "Bacchus your ancient friend; unsuited he",
  "To this rude Cyclops.",
  "",
  "CHORUS:",
  "Oh my dearest friend,",
  "That I could see that day, and leave for ever",
  "The impious Cyclops.",
  "",

  "Than is the music of an Asian lyre",
  "Would be the news of Polypheme destroyed.",
  "",
  "ULYSSES:",
  "Delighted with the Bacchic drink he goes",
  "To call his brother Cyclops--who inhabit",
  "A village upon Aetna not far off.",
  "",
  "CHORUS:",
  "I understand, catching him when alone",
  "You think by some measure to dispatch him,",
  "Or thrust him from the precipice.",
  "",
  "ULYSSES:",
  "Oh no;",
  "Nothing of that kind; my device is subtle.",
  "",
  "CHORUS:",
