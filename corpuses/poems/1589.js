  "Oh! did you observe the Black Canon pass,",
  "And did you observe his frown?",
  "He goeth to say the midnight mass,",
  "In holy St. Edmond's town.",
  "",
  "He goeth to sing the burial chaunt,",
  "And to lay the wandering sprite,",
  "Whose shadowy, restless form doth haunt,",
  "The Abbey's drear aisle this night.",
  "",
  "It saith it will not its wailing cease,",
  "'Till that holy man come near,",
  "'Till he pour o'er its grave the prayer of peace,",

  "The Canon's horse is stout and strong",
  "The road is plain and fair,",

  "'Prepare! for thy hour is near.'",

  "He crosses his breast, he mutters a prayer,",
  "To Heaven he lifts his eye,",
  "He heeds not the Abbot's gazing stare,",

  "Bare-headed he worships the sculptured saints",
  "That frown on the sacred walls,",
  "His face it grows pale,--he trembles, he faints,",
  "At the Abbot's feet he falls.",
  "",

  "",
  "'Now haste within! the board is spread,",
  "Keen blows the air, and cold,",
  "The spectre sleeps in its earthy bed,",
  "'Till St. Edmond's bell hath tolled,--",
  "",
  "'Yet rest your wearied limbs to-night,",
  "You've journeyed many a mile,",
  "To-morrow lay the wailing sprite,",
  "That shrieks in the moonlight aisle.",
  "",
  "'Oh! faint are my limbs and my bosom is cold,",

  "The torches slowly move before,",

  "But horror dimmed his eye--",
  "",
  "And now they climb the footworn stair,",
  "The chapel gates unclose,",
  "Now each breathed low a fervent prayer,",
  "And fear each bosom froze--",
  "",
  "Now paused awhile the doubtful band",
  "And viewed the solemn scene,--",
  "Full dark the clustered columns stand,",
  "The moon gleams pale between--",

  "'Say father, say, what cloisters' gloom",

  "",
  "'Through yonder drear aisle alone it walks,",
  "And murmurs a mournful plaint,",
  "Of thee! Black Canon, it wildly talks,",

  "'Oh! say upon that black marble tomb,",
  "What memorial sad appears.'--",
  "'Undistinguished it lies in the chancel's gloom,",
  "No memorial sad it bears'--",
  "",
  "The Canon his paternoster reads,",
  "His rosary hung by his side,",

  "Resistless, strange sounds his steps impel,",
  "To approach to the black marble tomb,",
  "'Oh! enter, Black Canon,' a whisper fell,",
  "'Oh! enter, thy hour is come.'",
  "",
  "He paused, told his beads, and the threshold passed.",
  "Oh! horror, the chancel doors close,",
  "A loud yell was borne on the rising blast,",
  "And a deep, dying groan arose.",

  "The Monks in amazement shuddering stand,",
  "They burst through the chancel's gloom,",
  "From St. Edmond's shrine, lo! a skeleton's hand,",
  "Points to the black marble tomb.",

  "",
  "The inscription was gone! a cross on the ground,",
  "And a rosary shone through the gloom,",
  "But never again was the Canon there found,",
  "Or the Ghost on the black marble tomb.",
