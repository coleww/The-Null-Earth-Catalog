  "So now my summer-task is ended, Mary,",
  "And I return to thee, mine own heart's home;",
  "As to his Queen some victor Knight of Faery,",
  "Earning bright spoils for her enchanted dome;",
  "Nor thou disdain, that ere my fame become",
  "A star among the stars of mortal night,",
  "If it indeed may cleave its natal gloom,",
  "Its doubtful promise thus I would unite",
  "With thy beloved name, thou Child of love and light.",
  "",
  "The toil which stole from thee so many an hour,",
  "Is ended,--and the fruit is at thy feet!",
  "No longer where the woods to frame a bower",
  "With interlaced branches mix and meet,",
  "Or where with sound like many voices sweet,",
  "Waterfalls leap among wild islands green,",
  "Which framed for my lone boat a lone retreat",
  "Of moss-grown trees and weeds, shall I be seen;",
  "But beside thee, where still my heart has ever been.",
  "",
  "Thoughts of great deeds were mine, dear Friend, when first",
  "The clouds which wrap this world from youth did pass.",
  "I do remember well the hour which burst",
  "My spirit's sleep. A fresh May-dawn it was,",
  "When I walked forth upon the glittering grass,",
  "And wept, I knew not why; until there rose",
  "From the near schoolroom, voices that, alas!",
  "Were but one echo from a world of woes--",
  "The harsh and grating strife of tyrants and of foes.",
  "",
  "And then I clasped my hands and looked around--",
  "--But none was near to mock my streaming eyes,",
  "Which poured their warm drops on the sunny ground--",
  "So without shame I spake:--'I will be wise,",
  "And just, and free, and mild, if in me lies",
  "Such power, for I grow weary to behold",
  "The selfish and the strong still tyrannise",
  "Without reproach or check.' I then controlled",
  "My tears, my heart grew calm, and I was meek and bold.",
  "",
  "And from that hour did I with earnest thought",
  "Heap knowledge from forbidden mines of lore;",
  "Yet nothing that my tyrants knew or taught",
  "I cared to learn, but from that secret store",
  "Wrought linked armour for my soul, before",
  "It might walk forth to war among mankind;",
  "Thus power and hope were strengthened more and more",
  "Within me, till there came upon my mind",
  "A sense of loneliness, a thirst with which I pined.",
  "",
  "Alas, that love should be a blight and snare",
  "To those who seek all sympathies in one!--",
  "Such once I sought in vain; then black despair,",
  "The shadow of a starless night, was thrown",
  "Over the world in which I moved alone:--",

  "Of Custom thou didst burst and rend in twain,",
  "And walked as free as light the clouds among,",
  "Which many an envious slave then breathed in vain",
  "From his dim dungeon, and my spirit sprung",
  "To meet thee from the woes which had begirt it long!",
  "",
  "No more alone through the world's wilderness,",
  "Although I trod the paths of high intent,",
  "I journeyed now: no more companionless,",
  "Where solitude is like despair, I went.--",
  "There is the wisdom of a stern content",
  "When Poverty can blight the just and good,",
  "When Infamy dares mock the innocent,",
  "And cherished friends turn with the multitude",
  "To trample: this was ours, and we unshaken stood!",
  "",
  "Now has descended a serener hour,",
  "And with inconstant fortune, friends return;",
  "Though suffering leaves the knowledge and the power",
  "Which says:--Let scorn be not repaid with scorn.",
  "And from thy side two gentle babes are born",
  "To fill our home with smiles, and thus are we",
  "Most fortunate beneath life's beaming morn;",
  "And these delights, and thou, have been to me",
  "The parents of the Song I consecrate to thee.",
  "",
  "Is it that now my inexperienced fingers",
  "But strike the prelude of a loftier strain?",
  "Or, must the lyre on which my spirit lingers",

  "And in thy gentle speech, a prophecy",
  "Is whispered, to subdue my fondest fears:",
  "And through thine eyes, even in thy soul I see",
  "A lamp of vestal fire burning internally.",
  "",
  "They say that thou wert lovely from thy birth,",
  "Of glorious parents thou aspiring Child.",
  "I wonder not--for One then left this earth",
  "Whose life was like a setting planet mild,",
  "Which clothed thee in the radiance undefiled",
  "Of its departing glory; still her fame",
  "Shines on thee, through the tempests dark and wild",
  "Which shake these latter days; and thou canst claim",
  "The shelter, from thy Sire, of an immortal name.",
  "",
  "One voice came forth from many a mighty spirit,",
  "Which was the echo of three thousand years;",
  "And the tumultuous world stood mute to hear it,",
  "As some lone man who in a desert hears",
  "The music of his home:--unwonted fears",
  "Fell on the pale oppressors of our race,",
  "And Faith, and Custom, and low-thoughted cares,",

  "",
  "Truth's deathless voice pauses among mankind!",
  "If there must be no response to my cry--",
  "If men must rise and stamp with fury blind",
  "On his pure name who loves them,--thou and I,",
  "Sweet friend! can look from our tranquillity",

  "CANTO 1.",
  "",
  "When the last hope of trampled France had failed",
  "Like a brief dream of unremaining glory,",
  "From visions of despair I rose, and scaled",
  "The peak of an aerial promontory,",
  "Whose caverned base with the vexed surge was hoary;",
  "And saw the golden dawn break forth, and waken",
  "Each cloud, and every wave:--but transitory",
  "The calm; for sudden, the firm earth was shaken,",
  "As if by the last wreck its frame were overtaken.",
  "",
  "So as I stood, one blast of muttering thunder",
  "Burst in far peals along the waveless deep,",
  "When, gathering fast, around, above, and under,",
  "Long trains of tremulous mist began to creep,",
  "Until their complicating lines did steep",
  "The orient sun in shadow:--not a sound",
  "Was heard; one horrible repose did keep",
  "The forests and the floods, and all around",
  "Darkness more dread than night was poured upon the ground.",
  "",
  "Hark! 'tis the rushing of a wind that sweeps",
  "Earth and the ocean. See! the lightnings yawn",
  "Deluging Heaven with fire, and the lashed deeps",
  "Glitter and boil beneath: it rages on,",
  "One mighty stream, whirlwind and waves upthrown,",
  "Lightning, and hail, and darkness eddying by.",
  "There is a pause--the sea-birds, that were gone",
  "Into their caves to shriek, come forth, to spy",
  "What calm has fall'n on earth, what light is in the sky.",
  "",
  "For, where the irresistible storm had cloven",
  "That fearful darkness, the blue sky was seen",
  "Fretted with many a fair cloud interwoven",
  "Most delicately, and the ocean green,",
  "Beneath that opening spot of blue serene,",
  "Quivered like burning emerald; calm was spread",
  "On all below; but far on high, between",
  "Earth and the upper air, the vast clouds fled,",
  "Countless and swift as leaves on autumn's tempest shed.",
  "",
  "For ever, as the war became more fierce",
  "Between the whirlwinds and the rack on high,",
  "That spot grew more serene; blue light did pierce",
  "The woof of those white clouds, which seem to lie",
  "Far, deep, and motionless; while through the sky",
  "The pallid semicircle of the moon",
  "Passed on, in slow and moving majesty;",
  "Its upper horn arrayed in mists, which soon",
  "But slowly fled, like dew beneath the beams of noon.",
  "",
  "I could not choose but gaze; a fascination",
  "Dwelt in that moon, and sky, and clouds, which drew",
  "My fancy thither, and in expectation",
  "Of what I knew not, I remained:--the hue",
  "Of the white moon, amid that heaven so blue,",
  "Suddenly stained with shadow did appear;",
  "A speck, a cloud, a shape, approaching grew,",
  "Like a great ship in the sun's sinking sphere",
  "Beheld afar at sea, and swift it came anear.",
  "",
  "Even like a bark, which from a chasm of mountains,",
  "Dark, vast and overhanging, on a river",
  "Which there collects the strength of all its fountains,",
  "Comes forth, whilst with the speed its frame doth quiver,",
  "Sails, oars and stream, tending to one endeavour;",
  "So, from that chasm of light a winged Form",
  "On all the winds of heaven approaching ever",
  "Floated, dilating as it came; the storm",
  "Pursued it with fierce blasts, and lightnings swift and warm.",
  "",
  "A course precipitous, of dizzy speed,",
  "Suspending thought and breath; a monstrous sight!",
  "For in the air do I behold indeed",
  "An Eagle and a Serpent wreathed in fight:--",
  "And now, relaxing its impetuous flight,",
  "Before the aerial rock on which I stood,",
  "The Eagle, hovering, wheeled to left and right,",
  "And hung with lingering wings over the flood,",
  "And startled with its yells the wide air's solitude.",
  "",
  "A shaft of light upon its wings descended,",
  "And every golden feather gleamed therein--",
  "Feather and scale, inextricably blended.",
  "The Serpent's mailed and many-coloured skin",
  "Shone through the plumes its coils were twined within",
  "By many a swoln and knotted fold, and high",
  "And far, the neck, receding lithe and thin,",
  "Sustained a crested head, which warily",
  "Shifted and glanced before the Eagle's steadfast eye.",
  "",
  "Around, around, in ceaseless circles wheeling",
  "With clang of wings and scream, the Eagle sailed",
  "Incessantly--sometimes on high concealing",
  "Its lessening orbs, sometimes as if it failed,",
  "Drooped through the air; and still it shrieked and wailed,",
  "And casting back its eager head, with beak",
  "And talon unremittingly assailed",
  "The wreathed Serpent, who did ever seek",
  "Upon his enemy's heart a mortal wound to wreak.",
  "",
  "What life, what power, was kindled and arose",
  "Within the sphere of that appalling fray!",
  "For, from the encounter of those wondrous foes,",
  "A vapour like the sea's suspended spray",
  "Hung gathered; in the void air, far away,",
  "Floated the shattered plumes; bright scales did leap,",
  "Where'er the Eagle's talons made their way,",
  "Like sparks into the darkness;--as they sweep,",
  "Blood stains the snowy foam of the tumultuous deep.",
  "",
  "Swift chances in that combat--many a check,",
  "And many a change, a dark and wild turmoil;",
  "Sometimes the Snake around his enemy's neck",
  "Locked in stiff rings his adamantine coil,",
  "Until the Eagle, faint with pain and toil,",
  "Remitted his strong flight, and near the sea",
  "Languidly fluttered, hopeless so to foil",
  "His adversary, who then reared on high",
  "His red and burning crest, radiant with victory.",
  "",
  "Then on the white edge of the bursting surge,",
  "Where they had sunk together, would the Snake",
  "Relax his suffocating grasp, and scourge",
  "The wind with his wild writhings; for to break",
  "That chain of torment, the vast bird would shake",
  "The strength of his unconquerable wings",
  "As in despair, and with his sinewy neck,",
  "Dissolve in sudden shock those linked rings--",
  "Then soar, as swift as smoke from a volcano springs.",
  "",
  "Wile baffled wile, and strength encountered strength,",
  "Thus long, but unprevailing:--the event",
  "Of that portentous fight appeared at length:",
  "Until the lamp of day was almost spent",
  "It had endured, when lifeless, stark, and rent,",
  "Hung high that mighty Serpent, and at last",
  "Fell to the sea, while o'er the continent",
  "With clang of wings and scream the Eagle passed,",
  "Heavily borne away on the exhausted blast.",
  "",
  "And with it fled the tempest, so that ocean",
  "And earth and sky shone through the atmosphere--",
  "Only, 'twas strange to see the red commotion",
  "Of waves like mountains o'er the sinking sphere",
  "Of sunset sweep, and their fierce roar to hear",
  "Amid the calm: down the steep path I wound",
  "To the sea-shore--the evening was most clear",
  "And beautiful, and there the sea I found",
  "Calm as a cradled child in dreamless slumber bound.",
  "",
  "There was a Woman, beautiful as morning,",
  "Sitting beneath the rocks, upon the sand",
  "Of the waste sea--fair as one flower adorning",
  "An icy wilderness; each delicate hand",
  "Lay crossed upon her bosom, and the band",
  "Of her dark hair had fall'n, and so she sate",
  "Looking upon the waves; on the bare strand",
  "Upon the sea-mark a small boat did wait,",
  "Fair as herself, like Love by Hope left desolate.",
  "",
  "It seemed that this fair Shape had looked upon",
  "That unimaginable fight, and now",
  "That her sweet eyes were weary of the sun,",
  "As brightly it illustrated her woe;",
  "For in the tears which silently to flow",
  "Paused not, its lustre hung: she watching aye",
  "The foam-wreaths which the faint tide wove below",
  "Upon the spangled sands, groaned heavily,",
  "And after every groan looked up over the sea.",
  "",
  "And when she saw the wounded Serpent make",
  "His path between the waves, her lips grew pale,",
  "Parted, and quivered; the tears ceased to break",
  "From her immovable eyes; no voice of wail",
  "Escaped her; but she rose, and on the gale",
  "Loosening her star-bright robe and shadowy hair",
  "Poured forth her voice; the caverns of the vale",
  "That opened to the ocean, caught it there,",
  "And filled with silver sounds the overflowing air.",
  "",
  "She spake in language whose strange melody",
  "Might not belong to earth. I heard alone,",
  "What made its music more melodious be,",
  "The pity and the love of every tone;",
  "But to the Snake those accents sweet were known",
  "His native tongue and hers; nor did he beat",
  "The hoar spray idly then, but winding on",
  "Through the green shadows of the waves that meet",
  "Near to the shore, did pause beside her snowy feet.",
  "",
  "Then on the sands the Woman sate again,",
  "And wept and clasped her hands, and all between,",
  "Renewed the unintelligible strain",
  "Of her melodious voice and eloquent mien;",
  "And she unveiled her bosom, and the green",
  "And glancing shadows of the sea did play",
  "O'er its marmoreal depth:--one moment seen,",
  "For ere the next, the Serpent did obey",
  "Her voice, and, coiled in rest in her embrace it lay.",
  "",
  "Then she arose, and smiled on me with eyes",
  "Serene yet sorrowing, like that planet fair,",
  "While yet the daylight lingereth in the skies",
  "Which cleaves with arrowy beams the dark-red air,",
  "And said: 'To grieve is wise, but the despair",
  "Was weak and vain which led thee here from sleep:",
  "This shalt thou know, and more, if thou dost dare",
  "With me and with this Serpent, o'er the deep,",
  "A voyage divine and strange, companionship to keep.'",
  "",
  "Her voice was like the wildest, saddest tone,",
  "Yet sweet, of some loved voice heard long ago.",
  "I wept. 'Shall this fair woman all alone,",
  "Over the sea with that fierce Serpent go?",
  "His head is on her heart, and who can know",
  "How soon he may devour his feeble prey?'--",
  "Such were my thoughts, when the tide gan to flow;",
  "And that strange boat like the moon's shade did sway",
  "Amid reflected stars that in the waters lay:--",
  "",
  "A boat of rare device, which had no sail",
  "But its own curved prow of thin moonstone,",
  "Wrought like a web of texture fine and frail,",
  "To catch those gentlest winds which are not known",
  "To breathe, but by the steady speed alone",
  "With which it cleaves the sparkling sea; and now",
  "We are embarked--the mountains hang and frown",
  "Over the starry deep that gleams below,",
  "A vast and dim expanse, as o'er the waves we go.",
  "",
  "And as we sailed, a strange and awful tale",
  "That Woman told, like such mysterious dream",
  "As makes the slumberer's cheek with wonder pale!",
  "'Twas midnight, and around, a shoreless stream,",
  "Wide ocean rolled, when that majestic theme",
  "Shrined in her heart found utterance, and she bent",
  "Her looks on mine; those eyes a kindling beam",
  "Of love divine into my spirit sent,",
  "And ere her lips could move, made the air eloquent.",
  "",
  "'Speak not to me, but hear! Much shalt thou learn,",
  "Much must remain unthought, and more untold,",
  "In the dark Future's ever-flowing urn:",
  "Know then, that from the depth of ages old",
  "Two Powers o'er mortal things dominion hold,",
  "Ruling the world with a divided lot,",
  "Immortal, all-pervading, manifold,",
  "Twin Genii, equal Gods--when life and thought",
  "Sprang forth, they burst the womb of inessential Nought.",
  "",
  "'The earliest dweller of the world, alone,",
  "Stood on the verge of chaos. Lo! afar",
  "O'er the wide wild abyss two meteors shone,",
  "Sprung from the depth of its tempestuous jar:",
  "A blood-red Comet and the Morning Star",
  "Mingling their beams in combat--as he stood,",
  "All thoughts within his mind waged mutual war,",
  "In dreadful sympathy--when to the flood",
  "That fair Star fell, he turned and shed his brother's blood.",
  "",
  "'Thus evil triumphed, and the Spirit of evil,",
  "One Power of many shapes which none may know,",
  "One Shape of many names; the Fiend did revel",
  "In victory, reigning o'er a world of woe,",
  "For the new race of man went to and fro,",
  "Famished and homeless, loathed and loathing, wild,",
  "And hating good--for his immortal foe,",
  "He changed from starry shape, beauteous and mild,",
  "To a dire Snake, with man and beast unreconciled.",
  "",
  "'The darkness lingering o'er the dawn of things,",
  "Was Evil's breath and life; this made him strong",
  "To soar aloft with overshadowing wings;",
  "And the great Spirit of Good did creep among",
  "The nations of mankind, and every tongue",
  "Cursed and blasphemed him as he passed; for none",
  "Knew good from evil, though their names were hung",
  "In mockery o'er the fane where many a groan,",
  "As King, and Lord, and God, the conquering Fiend did own,--",
  "",
  "'The Fiend, whose name was Legion: Death, Decay,",
  "Earthquake and Blight, and Want, and Madness pale,",
  "Winged and wan diseases, an array",
  "Numerous as leaves that strew the autumnal gale;",
  "Poison, a snake in flowers, beneath the veil",
  "Of food and mirth, hiding his mortal head;",
  "And, without whom all these might nought avail,",
  "Fear, Hatred, Faith, and Tyranny, who spread",
  "Those subtle nets which snare the living and the dead.",

  "And in quick smiles whose light would come and go",
  "Like music o'er wide waves, and in the flow",
  "Of sudden tears, and in the mute caress--",
  "For a deep shade was cleft, and we did know,",
  "That virtue, though obscured on Earth, not less",
  "Survives all mortal change in lasting loveliness.",
  "",
  "Three days and nights we sailed, as thought and feeling",
  "Number delightful hours--for through the sky",
  "The sphered lamps of day and night, revealing",
  "New changes and new glories, rolled on high,",
  "Sun, Moon and moonlike lamps, the progeny",
  "Of a diviner Heaven, serene and fair:",
  "On the fourth day, wild as a windwrought sea",
  "The stream became, and fast and faster bare",
  "The spirit-winged boat, steadily speeding there.",
  "",
  "Steady and swift, where the waves rolled like mountains",
  "Within the vast ravine, whose rifts did pour",
  "Tumultuous floods from their ten thousand fountains,",
  "The thunder of whose earth-uplifting roar",
  "Made the air sweep in whirlwinds from the shore,",
  "Calm as a shade, the boat of that fair child",
  "Securely fled, that rapid stress before,",
  "Amid the topmost spray, and sunbows wild,",
  "Wreathed in the silver mist: in joy and pride we smiled.",
  "",
  "The torrent of that wide and raging river",
  "Is passed, and our aereal speed suspended.",
  "We look behind; a golden mist did quiver",
  "When its wild surges with the lake were blended,--",
  "Our bark hung there, as on a line suspended",
  "Between two heavens,--that windless waveless lake",
  "Which four great cataracts from four vales, attended",
  "By mists, aye feed; from rocks and clouds they break,",
  "And of that azure sea a silent refuge make.",
  "",
  "Motionless resting on the lake awhile,",
  "I saw its marge of snow-bright mountains rear",
  "Their peaks aloft, I saw each radiant isle,",
  "And in the midst, afar, even like a sphere",
  "Hung in one hollow sky, did there appear",
  "The Temple of the Spirit; on the sound",
  "Which issued thence, drawn nearer and more near,",
  "Like the swift moon this glorious earth around,",
  "The charmed boat approached, and there its haven found.",
