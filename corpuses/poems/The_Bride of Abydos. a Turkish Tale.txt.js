  "Which mocks the tempest's withering hour,",
  "And buds unsheltered by a bower;",
  "Nor droops, though Spring refuse her shower,",
  "  Nor woos the Summer beam:",
  "To it the livelong night there sings",
  "  A Bird unseen--but not remote:",
  "Invisible his airy wings,",
  "But soft as harp that Houri strings",
  "  His long entrancing note!",
  "It were the Bulbul; but his throat,",
  "  Though mournful, pours not such a strain:",
  "For they who listen cannot leave",
  "The spot, but linger there and grieve,",
  "  As if they loved in vain!",
  "And yet so sweet the tears they shed,",
  "'Tis sorrow so unmixed with dread,",
  "They scarce can bear the morn to break",
  "  That melancholy spell,",
  "And longer yet would weep and wake,",
  "  He sings so wild and well!",
  "But when the day-blush bursts from high",
  "  Expires that magic melody.",
  "And some have been who could believe,",
  "(So fondly youthful dreams deceive,",
  "  Yet harsh be they that blame,)",
  "That note so piercing and profound",
  "Will shape and syllable its sound",
  "  Into Zuleika's name.",
  "'Tis from her cypress summit heard,",
  "That melts in air the liquid word:",
  "'Tis from her lowly virgin earth",
  "That white rose takes its tender birth.",
  "There late was laid a marble stone;",
  "Eve saw it placed--the Morrow gone!",
  "It was no mortal arm that bore",
  "That deep fixed pillar to the shore;",
  "For there, as Helle's legends tell,",
  "Next morn 'twas found where Selim fell;",
  "Lashed by the tumbling tide, whose wave",
  "Denied his bones a holier grave:",
  "And there by night, reclined, 'tis said.",
  "Is seen a ghastly turbaned head:",
  "  And hence extended by the billow,",
  "  'Tis named the \"Pirate-phantom's pillow!\"",
  "  Where first it lay that mourning flower",
  "  Hath flourished; flourisheth this hour,",
  "Alone and dewy--coldly pure and pale;",
  "As weeping Beauty's cheek at Sorrow's tale!",
