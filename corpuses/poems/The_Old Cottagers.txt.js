  "Of the coy nightingale was yearly found,",
  "Safe from all eyes as in the loneliest ground;",

  "A nest with cobwebs there will build, and fly",
  "Upon the kidney bean that twines and towers",
  "Up little poles in wreaths of scarlet flowers.",

  "With tottering age, and dignified content,",
  "Through a rich length of years and quiet days,",
  "And filled the neighbouring village with their praise.",
