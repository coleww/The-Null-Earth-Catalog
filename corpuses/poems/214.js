  "Which faintly glimmered through her starting tears,",
  "Pressed into light by silent misery,",
  "Hath soul's imperishable energy.",
  "She was a cripple, and incapable",

  "That poverty, the crime of tainting stain,",
  "Would merge her in its depths, never to rise again.",
  "",
  "One only son's love had supported her.",
  "She long had struggled with infirmity,",
  "Lingering to human life-scenes; for to die,",
  "When fate has spared to rend some mental tie,",

  "For his cursed power unhallowed arms to wield--",
  "Bend to another's will--become a thing",
  "More senseless than the sword of battlefield--",
  "Then did she feel keen sorrow's keenest sting;",
  "And many years had passed ere comfort they would bring.",
  "",
  "For seven years did this poor woman live",
  "In unparticipated solitude.",
  "Thou mightst have seen her in the forest rude",
  "Picking the scattered remnants of its wood.",
  "If human, thou mightst then have learned to grieve.",
  "The gleanings of precarious charity",

  "",
  "It was an eve of June, when every star",
  "Spoke peace from Heaven to those on earth that live.",
  "She rested on the moor. 'Twas such an eve",
  "When first her soul began indeed to grieve:",
  "Then he was here; now he is very far.",
  "The sweetness of the balmy evening",
  "A sorrow o'er her aged soul did fling,",
  "Yet not devoid of rapture's mingled tear:",
  "A balm was in the poison of the sting.",
  "This aged sufferer for many a year",
  "Had never felt such comfort. She suppressed",
  "A sigh--and turning round, clasped William to her breast!",
  "",
  "And, though his form was wasted by the woe",
  "Which tyrants on their victims love to wreak,",
  "Though his sunk eyeballs and his faded cheek",

  "The vital fire seemed re-illumed within",
  "By this sweet unexpected welcoming.",
  "Oh, consummation of the fondest hope",

  "",
  "And now cold charity's unwelcome dole",
  "Was insufficient to support the pair;",
  "And they would perish rather than would bear",
