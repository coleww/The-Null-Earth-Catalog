  "Soon as the twilight through the distant mist",
  "In silver hemmings skirts the purple east,",
  "Ere yet the sun unveils his smiles to view",
  "And dries the morning's chilly robes of dew,",
  "Young Hodge the horse-boy, with a soodly gait,",
  "Slow climbs the stile, or opes the creaky gate,",
  "With willow switch and halter by his side",
  "Prepared for Dobbin, whom he means to ride;",
  "The only tune he knows still whistling oer,",
  "And humming scraps his father sung before,",
  "As \"Wantley Dragon,\" and the \"Magic Rose,\"",
  "The whole of music that his village knows,",
  "Which wild remembrance, in each little town,",
  "From mouth to mouth through ages handles down.",
  "Onward he jolls, nor can the minstrel-throngs",
  "Entice him once to listen to their songs;",
  "Nor marks he once a blossom on his way;",
  "A senseless lump of animated clay--",
  "With weather-beaten hat of rusty brown,",
  "Stranger to brinks, and often to a crown;",
  "With slop-frock suiting to the ploughman's taste,",
  "Its greasy skirtings twisted round his waist;",
  "And hardened high-lows clenched with nails around,",
  "Clamping defiance oer the stoney ground,",
  "The deadly foes to many a blossomed sprout",
  "That luckless meets him in his morning's rout.",
  "In hobbling speed he roams the pasture round,",
  "Till hunted Dobbin and the rest are found;",
  "Where some, from frequent meddlings of his whip,",
  "Well know their foe, and often try to slip;",
  "While Dobbin, tamed by age and labour, stands",
  "To meet all trouble from his brutish hands,",
  "And patient goes to gate or knowly brake,",
  "The teasing burden of his foe to take;",
  "Who, soon as mounted, with his switching weals,",
  "Puts Dob's best swiftness in his heavy heels,",
  "The toltering bustle of a blundering trot",
  "Which whips and cudgels neer increased a jot,",
  "Though better speed was urged by the clown--",
  "And thus he snorts and jostles to the town.",
  "",
  "And now, when toil and summer's in its prime,",
  "In every vill, at morning's earliest time,",
  "To early-risers many a Hodge is seen,",
  "And many a Dob's heard clattering oer the green.",
  "",
  "Now straying beams from day's unclosing eye",
  "In copper-coloured patches flush the sky,",
  "And from night's prison strugglingly encroach,",
  "To bring the summons of warm day's approach,",
  "Till, slowly mounting oer the ridge of clouds",
  "That yet half shows his face, and half enshrouds,",
  "The unfettered sun takes his unbounded reign",
  "And wakes all life to noise and toil again:",
  "And while his opening mellows oer the scenes",
  "Of wood and field their many mingling greens,",
  "Industry's bustling din once more devours",
  "The soothing peace of morning's early hours:",
  "The grunt of hogs freed from their nightly dens",
  "And constant cacklings of new-laying hens,",
  "And ducks and geese that clamorous joys repeat",
  "The splashing comforts of the pond to meet,",
  "And chirping sparrows dropping from the eaves",
  "For offal kernels that the poultry leaves,",
  "Oft signal-calls of danger chittering high",
  "At skulking cats and dogs approaching nigh.",
  "And lowing steers that hollow echoes wake",
  "Around the yard, their nightly fast to break,",
  "As from each barn the lumping flail rebounds",
  "In mingling concert with the rural sounds;",
  "While oer the distant fields more faintly creep",
  "The murmuring bleatings of unfolding sheep,",
  "And ploughman's callings that more hoarse proceed",
  "Where industry still urges labour's speed,",
  "The bellowing of cows with udders full",
  "That wait the welcome halloo of \"come mull,\"",
  "And rumbling waggons deafening again,",
  "Rousing the dust along the narrow lane,",
  "And cracking whips, and shepherd's hooting cries,",
  "From woodland echoes urging sharp replies.",
  "Hodge, in his waggon, marks the wondrous tongue,",
  "And talks with echo as he drives along;",
  "Still cracks his whip, bawls every horse's name,",
  "And echo still as ready bawls the same:",
  "The puzzling mystery he would gladly cheat,",
  "And fain would utter what it can't repeat,",
  "Till speedless trials prove the doubted elf",
  "As skilled in noise and sounds as Hodge himself;",
  "And, quite convinced with the proofs it gives,",
  "The boy drives on and fancies echo lives,",
  "Like some wood-fiend that frights benighted men,",
  "The troubling spirit of a robber's den.",
  "",
  "And now the blossom of the village view,",
  "With airy hat of straw, and apron blue,",
  "And short-sleeved gown, that half to guess reveals",
  "By fine-turned arms what beauty it conceals;",
  "Whose cheeks health flushes with as sweet a red",
  "As that which stripes the woodbine oer her head;",
  "Deeply she blushes on her morn's employ,",
  "To prove the fondness of some passing boy,",
  "Who, with a smile that thrills her soul to view,",
  "Holds the gate open till she passes through,",
  "While turning nods beck thanks for kindness done,",
  "And looks--if looks could speak-proclaim her won.",
  "With well-scoured buckets on proceeds the maid,",
  "And drives her cows to milk beneath the shade,",
  "Where scarce a sunbeam to molest her steals--",
  "Sweet as the thyme that blossoms where she kneels;",
  "And there oft scares the cooing amorous dove",
  "With her own favoured melodies of love.",
  "Snugly retired in yet dew-laden bowers,",
  "This sweetest specimen of rural flowers",
  "Displays, red glowing in the morning wind,",
  "The powers of health and nature when combined.",
  "",
  "Last on the road the cowboy careless swings,",
  "Leading tamed cattle in their tending strings,",
  "With shining tin to keep his dinner warm",
  "Swung at his back, or tucked beneath his arm;",
  "Whose sun-burnt skin, and cheeks chuffed out with fat,",
  "Are dyed as rusty as his napless hat.",
  "And others, driving loose their herds at will,",
  "Are now heard whooping up the pasture-hill;",
  "Peeled sticks they bear of hazel or of ash,",
  "The rib-marked hides of restless cows to thrash.",
  "In sloven garb appears each bawling boy,",
  "As fit and suiting to his rude employ;",
  "His shoes, worn down by many blundering treads,",
  "Oft show the tenants needing safer sheds:",
  "The pithy bunch of unripe nuts to seek,",
  "And crabs sun-reddened with a tempting cheek,",
  "From pasture hedges, daily puts to rack",
  "His tattered clothes, that scarcely screen the back,--",
  "Daubed all about as if besmeared with blood,",
  "Stained with the berries of the brambly wood",
  "That stud the straggling briars as black as jet,",
  "Which, when his cattle lair, he runs to get;",
  "Or smaller kinds, as if beglossed with dew",
  "Shining dim-powdered with a downy blue,",
  "That on weak tendrils lowly creeping grow",
  "Where, choaked in flags and sedges, wandering slow,",
  "The brook purls simmering its declining tide",
  "Down the crooked boundings of the pasture-side.",
  "There they to hunt the luscious fruit delight,",
  "And dabbling keep within their charges' sight;",
  "Oft catching prickly struttles on their rout,",
  "And miller-thumbs and gudgeons driving out,",
  "Hid near the arched brig under many a stone",
  "That from its wall rude passing clowns have thrown.",
  "And while in peace cows eat, and chew their cuds,",
  "Moozing cool sheltered neath the skirting woods,",
  "To double uses they the hours convert,",
  "Turning the toils of labour into sport;",
  "Till morn's long streaking shadows lose their tails,",
  "And cooling winds swoon into faultering gales;",
  "And searching sunbeams warm and sultry creep,",
  "Waking the teazing insects from their sleep;",
  "And dreaded gadflies with their drowsy hum",
  "On the burnt wings of mid-day zephyrs come,--",
  "Urging each lown to leave his sports in fear,",
  "  To stop his starting cows that dread the fly;",
  "Droning unwelcome tidings on his ear,",
  "  That the sweet peace of rural morn's gone by.",
