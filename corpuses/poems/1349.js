  "",
  "A glorious people vibrated again",
  "The lightning of the nations: Liberty",
  "From heart to heart, from tower to tower, o'er Spain,",
  "Scattering contagious fire into the sky,",
  "Gleamed. My soul spurned the chains of its dismay,",
  "And in the rapid plumes of song",
  "Clothed itself, sublime and strong;",
  "As a young eagle soars the morning clouds among,",
  "Hovering inverse o'er its accustomed prey;",
  "Till from its station in the Heaven of fame",
  "The Spirit's whirlwind rapped it, and the ray",
  "Of the remotest sphere of living flame",
  "Which paves the void was from behind it flung,",
  "As foam from a ship's swiftness, when there came",
  "A voice out of the deep: I will record the same.",
  "",
  "The Sun and the serenest Moon sprang forth:",
  "The burning stars of the abyss were hurled",
  "Into the depths of Heaven. The daedal earth,",
  "That island in the ocean of the world,",
  "Hung in its cloud of all-sustaining air:",
  "But this divinest universe",
  "Was yet a chaos and a curse,",
  "For thou wert not: but, power from worst producing worse,",
  "The spirit of the beasts was kindled there,",
  "And of the birds, and of the watery forms,",
  "And there was war among them, and despair",
  "Within them, raging without truce or terms:",
  "The bosom of their violated nurse",
  "Groaned, for beasts warred on beasts, and worms on worms,",
  "And men on men; each heart was as a hell of storms.",
  "",
  "Man, the imperial shape, then multiplied",
  "His generations under the pavilion",
  "Of the Sun's throne: palace and pyramid,",
  "Temple and prison, to many a swarming million",
  "Were, as to mountain-wolves their ragged caves.",
  "This human living multitude",
  "Was savage, cunning, blind, and rude,",
  "For thou wert not; but o'er the populous solitude,",
  "Like one fierce cloud over a waste of waves,",
  "Hung Tyranny; beneath, sate deified",
  "The sister-pest, congregator of slaves;",
  "Into the shadow of her pinions wide",
  "Anarchs and priests, who feed on gold and blood",
  "Till with the stain their inmost souls are dyed,",
  "Drove the astonished herds of men from every side.",
  "",
  "The nodding promontories, and blue isles,",
  "And cloud-like mountains, and dividuous waves",
  "Of Greece, basked glorious in the open smiles",
  "Of favouring Heaven: from their enchanted caves",
  "Prophetic echoes flung dim melody.",
  "On the unapprehensive wild",
  "The vine, the corn, the olive mild,",
  "Grew savage yet, to human use unreconciled;",
  "And, like unfolded flowers beneath the sea,",
  "Like the man's thought dark in the infant's brain,",
  "Like aught that is which wraps what is to be,",
  "Art's deathless dreams lay veiled by many a vein",
  "Of Parian stone; and, yet a speechless child,",
  "Verse murmured, and Philosophy did strain",
  "Her lidless eyes for thee; when o'er the Aegean main",
  "",
  "Athens arose: a city such as vision",
  "Builds from the purple crags and silver towers",
  "Of battlemented cloud, as in derision",
  "Of kingliest masonry: the ocean-floors",
  "Pave it; the evening sky pavilions it;",
  "Its portals are inhabited",
  "By thunder-zoned winds, each head",
  "Within its cloudy wings with sun-fire garlanded,--",
  "A divine work! Athens, diviner yet,",
  "Gleamed with its crest of columns, on the will",
  "Of man, as on a mount of diamond, set;",
  "For thou wert, and thine all-creative skill",
  "Peopled, with forms that mock the eternal dead",
  "In marble immortality, that hill",
  "Which was thine earliest throne and latest oracle.",
  "",
  "Within the surface of Time's fleeting river",
  "Its wrinkled image lies, as then it lay",

  "The voices of thy bards and sages thunder",
  "With an earth-awakening blast",
  "Through the caverns of the past:",
  "(Religion veils her eyes; Oppression shrinks aghast:)",
  "A winged sound of joy, and love, and wonder,",
  "Which soars where Expectation never flew,",
  "Rending the veil of space and time asunder!",
  "One ocean feeds the clouds, and streams, and dew;",
  "One Sun illumines Heaven; one Spirit vast",
  "With life and love makes chaos ever new,",
  "As Athens doth the world with thy delight renew.",
  "",
  "Then Rome was, and from thy deep bosom fairest,",
  "Like a wolf-cub from a Cadmaean Maenad,",
  "She drew the milk of greatness, though thy dearest",
  "From that Elysian food was yet unweaned;",
  "And many a deed of terrible uprightness",
  "By thy sweet love was sanctified;",
  "And in thy smile, and by thy side,",
  "Saintly Camillus lived, and firm Atilius died.",
  "But when tears stained thy robe of vestal-whiteness,",
  "And gold profaned thy Capitolian throne,",
  "Thou didst desert, with spirit-winged lightness,",
  "The senate of the tyrants: they sunk prone",
  "Slaves of one tyrant: Palatinus sighed",
  "Faint echoes of Ionian song; that tone",
  "Thou didst delay to hear, lamenting to disown",
  "",
  "From what Hyrcanian glen or frozen hill,",
  "Or piny promontory of the Arctic main,",
  "Or utmost islet inaccessible,",
  "Didst thou lament the ruin of thy reign,",
  "Teaching the woods and waves, and desert rocks,",
  "And every Naiad's ice-cold urn,",
  "To talk in echoes sad and stern",
  "Of that sublimest lore which man had dared unlearn?",
  "For neither didst thou watch the wizard flocks",
  "Of the Scald's dreams, nor haunt the Druid's sleep.",
  "What if the tears rained through thy shattered locks",
  "Were quickly dried? for thou didst groan, not weep,",
  "When from its sea of death, to kill and burn,",
  "The Galilean serpent forth did creep,",
  "And made thy world an undistinguishable heap.",
  "",
  "A thousand years the Earth cried, 'Where art thou?'",
  "And then the shadow of thy coming fell",
  "On Saxon Alfred's olive-cinctured brow:",
  "And many a warrior-peopled citadel.",
  "Like rocks which fire lifts out of the flat deep,",
  "Arose in sacred Italy,",
  "Frowning o'er the tempestuous sea",
  "Of kings, and priests, and slaves, in tower-crowned majesty;",
  "That multitudinous anarchy did sweep",
  "And burst around their walls, like idle foam,",
  "Whilst from the human spirit's deepest deep",
  "Strange melody with love and awe struck dumb",
  "Dissonant arms; and Art, which cannot die,",
  "With divine wand traced on our earthly home",
  "Fit imagery to pave Heaven's everlasting dome.",
  "",
  "Thou huntress swifter than the Moon! thou terror",
  "Of the world's wolves! thou bearer of the quiver,",
  "Whose sunlike shafts pierce tempest-winged Error,",
  "As light may pierce the clouds when they dissever",
  "In the calm regions of the orient day!",
  "Luther caught thy wakening glance;",
  "Like lightning, from his leaden lance",
  "Reflected, it dissolved the visions of the trance",
  "In which, as in a tomb, the nations lay;",
  "And England's prophets hailed thee as their queen,",
  "In songs whose music cannot pass away,",
  "Though it must flow forever: not unseen",
  "Before the spirit-sighted countenance",
  "Of Milton didst thou pass, from the sad scene",
  "Beyond whose night he saw, with a dejected mien.",
  "",
  "The eager hours and unreluctant years",
  "As on a dawn-illumined mountain stood.",
  "Trampling to silence their loud hopes and fears,",
  "Darkening each other with their multitude,",

  "Answered Pity from her cave;",
  "Death grew pale within the grave,",
  "And Desolation howled to the destroyer, Save!",
  "When like Heaven's Sun girt by the exhalation",
  "Of its own glorious light, thou didst arise.",
  "Chasing thy foes from nation unto nation",
  "Like shadows: as if day had cloven the skies",
  "At dreaming midnight o'er the western wave,",
  "Men started, staggering with a glad surprise,",
  "Under the lightnings of thine unfamiliar eyes.",
  "",
  "Thou Heaven of earth! what spells could pall thee then",
  "In ominous eclipse? a thousand years",
  "Bred from the slime of deep Oppression's den.",
  "Dyed all thy liquid light with blood and tears.",
  "Till thy sweet stars could weep the stain away;",
  "How like Bacchanals of blood",
  "Round France, the ghastly vintage, stood",
  "Destruction's sceptred slaves, and Folly's mitred brood!",
  "When one, like them, but mightier far than they,",
  "The Anarch of thine own bewildered powers,",
  "Rose: armies mingled in obscure array,",
  "Like clouds with clouds, darkening the sacred bowers",
  "Of serene Heaven. He, by the past pursued,",
  "Rests with those dead, but unforgotten hours,",
  "Whose ghosts scare victor kings in their ancestral towers.",
  "",
  "England yet sleeps: was she not called of old?",
  "Spain calls her now, as with its thrilling thunder",
  "Vesuvius wakens Aetna, and the cold",
  "Snow-crags by its reply are cloven in sunder:",

  "From Pithecusa to Pelorus",
  "Howls, and leaps, and glares in chorus:",
  "They cry, 'Be dim; ye lamps of Heaven suspended o'er us!'",
  "Her chains are threads of gold, she need but smile",
  "And they dissolve; but Spain's were links of steel,",
  "Till bit to dust by virtue's keenest file.",
  "Twins of a single destiny! appeal",
  "To the eternal years enthroned before us",
  "In the dim West; impress us from a seal,",
  "All ye have thought and done! Time cannot dare conceal.",
  "",
  "Tomb of Arminius! render up thy dead",
  "Till, like a standard from a watch-tower's staff,",
  "His soul may stream over the tyrant's head;",
  "Thy victory shall be his epitaph,",
  "Wild Bacchanal of truth's mysterious wine,",
  "King-deluded Germany,",
  "His dead spirit lives in thee.",
  "Why do we fear or hope? thou art already free!",

  "",
  "Oh, that the free would stamp the impious name",
  "Of KING into the dust! or write it there,",
  "So that this blot upon the page of fame",
  "Were as a serpent's path, which the light air",
  "Erases, and the flat sands close behind!",
  "Ye the oracle have heard:",
  "Lift the victory-flashing sword.",
  "And cut the snaky knots of this foul gordian word,",
  "Which, weak itself as stubble, yet can bind",
  "Into a mass, irrefragably firm,",
  "The axes and the rods which awe mankind;",

  "A scoff of impious pride from fiends impure;",
  "Till human thoughts might kneel alone,",
  "Each before the judgement-throne",
  "Of its own aweless soul, or of the Power unknown!",
  "Oh, that the words which make the thoughts obscure",
  "From which they spring, as clouds of glimmering dew",
  "From a white lake blot Heaven's blue portraiture,",
