  "When between her and her foes",
  "A mist, a light, an image rose,",
  "Small at first, and weak, and frail",
  "Like the vapour of a vale:",
  "",
  "Till as clouds grow on the blast,",
  "Like tower-crowned giants striding fast,",
  "And glare with lightnings as they fly,",
  "And speak in thunder to the sky,",

  "",
  "On its helm, seen far away,",
  "A planet, like the Morning's, lay;",
