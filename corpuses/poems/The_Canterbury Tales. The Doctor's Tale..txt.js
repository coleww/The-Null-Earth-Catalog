  "This knight one daughter hadde by his wife;",
  "No children had he more in all his life.",
  "Fair was this maid in excellent beauty",
  "Aboven ev'ry wight that man may see:",
  "For nature had with sov'reign diligence",
  "Y-formed her in so great excellence,",
  "As though she woulde say, \"Lo, I, Nature,",
  "Thus can I form and paint a creature,",
  "When that me list; who can me counterfeit?",
  "Pygmalion? not though he aye forge and beat,",
  "Or grave or painte: for I dare well sayn,",
  "Apelles, Zeuxis, shoulde work in vain,",
  "Either to grave, or paint, or forge, or beat,",
  "If they presumed me to counterfeit.",
  "For he that is the former principal,",
  "Hath made me his vicar-general",
  "To form and painten earthly creatures",
  "Right as me list, and all thing in my cure is,",
  "Under the moone, that may wane and wax.",

  "What colour that they have, or what figures.\"",
  "Thus seemeth me that Nature woulde say.",

  "And red a rose, right with such painture",
  "She painted had this noble creature,",
  "Ere she was born, upon her limbes free,",
  "Where as by right such colours shoulde be:",
  "And Phoebus dyed had her tresses great,",
  "Like to the streames of his burned heat.",
  "And if that excellent was her beauty,",
  "A thousand-fold more virtuous was she.",
  "In her there lacked no condition,",

  "Where likely was to treaten of folly,",
  "As is at feasts, at revels, and at dances,",
  "That be occasions of dalliances.",
  "Such thinges make children for to be",
