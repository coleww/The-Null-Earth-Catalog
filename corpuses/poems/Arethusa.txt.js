  "She leapt down the rocks,",
  "With her rainbow locks",
  "Streaming among the streams;--",
  "Her steps paved with green",
  "The downward ravine",
  "Which slopes to the western gleams;",
  "And gliding and springing",
  "She went, ever singing,",
  "In murmurs as soft as sleep;",
  "The Earth seemed to love her,",
  "And Heaven smiled above her,",
  "As she lingered towards the deep.",
  "",
  "Then Alpheus bold,",
  "On his glacier cold,",
  "With his trident the mountains strook;",
  "And opened a chasm",
  "In the rocks--with the spasm",
  "All Erymanthus shook.",
  "And the black south wind",
  "It unsealed behind",
  "The urns of the silent snow,",
  "And earthquake and thunder",
  "Did rend in sunder",
  "The bars of the springs below.",
  "And the beard and the hair",
  "Of the River-god were",
  "Seen through the torrent's sweep,",
  "As he followed the light",

  "The Earth's white daughter",
  "Fled like a sunny beam;",
  "Behind her descended",
  "Her billows, unblended",
  "With the brackish Dorian stream:--",
  "Like a gloomy stain",
  "On the emerald main",
  "Alpheus rushed behind,--",
  "As an eagle pursuing",
  "A dove to its ruin",
  "Down the streams of the cloudy wind.",

  "Under the bowers",
  "Where the Ocean Powers",
  "Sit on their pearled thrones;",

  "Where the shadowy waves",
  "Are as green as the forest's night:--",
  "Outspeeding the shark,",
  "And the sword-fish dark,",
  "Under the Ocean's foam,",
  "And up through the rifts",
  "Of the mountain clifts",
  "They passed to their Dorian home.",
  "",
  "And now from their fountains",
  "In Enna's mountains,",
  "Down one vale where the morning basks,",

  "At sunrise they leap",
  "From their cradles steep",
  "In the cave of the shelving hill;",

  "Like spirits that lie",
  "In the azure sky",
  "When they love but live no more.",
