  "THESE, I, singing in spring, collect for lovers,",

  "And who but I should be the poet of comrades?)",
  "Collecting, I traverse the garden, the world—but soon I pass the gates,",
  "Now along the pond-side—now wading in a little, fearing not the wet,",
  "Now by the post-and-rail fences, where the old stones thrown there, pick’d from the",
  "  fields,",
  "  have accumulated,",
  "(Wild-flowers and vines and weeds come up through the stones, and partly cover",
  "    them—Beyond",
  "  these I pass,)",
  "Far, far in the forest, before I think where I go,",
  "Solitary, smelling the earthy smell, stopping now and then in the silence,",
  "Alone I had thought—yet soon a troop gathers around me,",
  "Some walk by my side, and some behind, and some embrace my arms or neck,",
  "They, the spirits of dear friends, dead or alive—thicker they come, a great crowd,",
  "    and I",
  "  in the",

  "Collecting, dispensing, singing in spring, there I wander with them,",
  "Plucking something for tokens—tossing toward whoever is near me;",
  "Here! lilac, with a branch of pine,",
  "Here, out of my pocket, some moss which I pull’d off a live-oak in Florida, as it",
  "    hung",
  "  trailing",
  "  down,",
  "Here, some pinks and laurel leaves, and a handful of sage,",
  "And here what I now draw from the water, wading in the pondside,",
  "(O here I last saw him that tenderly loves me—and returns again, never to separate",
  "    from",
  "  me,",
  "And this, O this shall henceforth be the token of comrades—this Calamus-root shall,",
  "Interchange it, youths, with each other! Let none render it back!)",
  "And twigs of maple, and a bunch of wild orange, and chestnut,",
  "And stems of currants, and plum-blows, and the aromatic cedar:",
  "These, I, compass’d around by a thick cloud of spirits,",
  "Wandering, point to, or touch as I pass, or throw them loosely from me,",
  "Indicating to each one what he shall have—giving something to each;",
  "But what I drew from the water by the pond-side, that I reserve,",
  "I will give of it—but only to them that love, as I myself am capable of loving.",
