  "Poet of mighty power, I fain",
  "Would court the muse that honoured thee,",
  "And, like Elisha's spirit, gain",
  "  A part of thy intensity;",
  "And share the mantle which she flung",
  "Around thee, when thy lyre was strung.",
  "",
  "Though faction's scorn at first did shun",
  "With coldness thy inspired song,",
  "Though clouds of malice passed thy sun,",
  "  They could not hide it long;",
  "Its brightness soon exhaled away",
  "Dank night, and gained eternal day.",
  "",
  "The critics' wrath did darkly frown",
  "Upon thy muse's mighty lay;",
  "But blasts that break the blossom down",
  "  Do only stir the bay;",
  "And thine shall flourish, green and long,",
  "With the eternity of song.",
  "",
  "Thy genius saw, in quiet mood,",
  "Gilt fashion's follies pass thee by,",
  "And, like the monarch of the wood,",
  "  Towered oer it to the sky,",
  "Where thou couldst sing of other spheres,",
  "And feel the fame of future years.",
  "",
  "Though bitter sneers and stinging scorns",
  "Did throng the muse's dangerous way,",
  "Thy powers were past such little thorns,",
  "  They gave thee no dismay;",
  "The scoffer's insult passed thee by,",

  "Fame lives not in the breath of words,",
  "In public praises' hue and cry;",
  "The music of these summer birds",
  "  Is silent in a winter sky,",
  "When thine shall live and flourish on,",

  "",
  "The ivy shuns the city wall,",
  "When busy clamorous crowds intrude,",
