  "Should you ask me,",
  "whence these stories?",
  "Whence these legends and traditions,",
  "With the odors of the forest",
  "With the dew and damp of meadows,",
  "With the curling smoke of wigwams,",
  "With the rushing of great rivers,",
  "With their frequent repetitions,",
  "And their wild reverberations",
  "As of thunder in the mountains?",

  "From the great lakes of the Northland,",
  "From the land of the Ojibways,",
  "From the land of the Dacotahs,",

  "\"In the vale of Tawasentha,",
  "In the green and silent valley,",
  "By the pleasant water-courses,",
  "Dwelt the singer Nawadaha.",
  "Round about the Indian village",
  "Spread the meadows and the corn-fields,",
  "And beyond them stood the forest,",
  "Stood the groves of singing pine-trees,",
  "Green in Summer, white in Winter,",
  "Ever sighing, ever singing.",
  "\"And the pleasant water-courses,",

  "By the rushing in the Spring-time,",
  "By the alders in the Summer,",
  "By the white fog in the Autumn,",
  "By the black line in the Winter;",
  "And beside them dwelt the singer,",
  "In the vale of Tawasentha,",
  "In the green and silent valley.",
  "\"There he sang of Hiawatha,",
  "Sang the Song of Hiawatha,",
  "Sang his wondrous birth and being,",

  "Love the wind among the branches,",
  "And the rain-shower and the snow-storm,",

  "Through their palisades of pine-trees,",
  "And the thunder in the mountains,",
  "Whose innumerable echoes",
  "Flap like eagles in their eyries;-",
  "Listen to these wild traditions,",
  "To this Song of Hiawatha!",
  "Ye who love a nation's legends,",
  "Love the ballads of a people,",
  "That like voices from afar off",
  "Call to us to pause and listen,",
  "Speak in tones so plain and childlike,",
  "Scarcely can the ear distinguish",
  "Whether they are sung or spoken;-",
  "Listen to this Indian Legend,",
  "To this Song of Hiawatha!",
  "Ye whose hearts are fresh and simple,",
  "Who have faith in God and Nature,",
  "Who believe that in all ages",
  "Every human heart is human,",
  "That in even savage bosoms",
  "There are longings, yearnings, strivings",
  "For the good they comprehend not,",
  "That the feeble hands and helpless,",
  "Groping blindly in the darkness,",
  "Touch God's right hand in that darkness",
  "And are lifted up and strengthened;-",
  "Listen to this simple story,",
  "To this Song of Hiawatha!",
  "Ye, who sometimes, in your rambles",
  "Through the green lanes of the country,",
  "Where the tangled barberry-bushes",
  "Hang their tufts of crimson berries",
  "Over stone walls gray with mosses,",
  "Pause by some neglected graveyard,",
  "For a while to muse, and ponder",
  "On a half-effaced inscription,",
  "Written with little skill of song-craft,",
  "Homely phrases, but each letter",
  "Full of hope and yet of heart-break,",
  "Full of all the tender pathos",
  "Of the Here and the Hereafter;",
  "Stay and read this rude inscription,",
  "Read this Song of Hiawatha!",
