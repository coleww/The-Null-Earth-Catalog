  "In that dark Hour a long loud gathered cry",
  "From out the billows pierced the sable sky,",
  "And borne o'er breakers reached the craggy shore--",
  "The Sea roars on--that Cry is heard no more.",
  "",
  "There is no vestige, in the Dawning light,",

  "The one of Many whom the withering Gale",
  "Hath left unpunished to record their Tale.",

  "He rose and with a feeble effort shaped",
  "His course unto the billows--late escaped:",
  "But weakness conquered--swam his dizzy glance,",
  "And down to Earth he sunk in silent trance.",

  "He raised young Julian from the sand, and such",
  "Strange power of healing dwelt within the touch,",
  "That his weak limbs grew light with freshened Power,",

  "Recalled at morning from the branch√©d brake,",
  "When the day's promise heralds early Spring,",
  "And Heaven unfolded woos their soaring wing:",
