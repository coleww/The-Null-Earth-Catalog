  "I stood beside the grave of him who blazed",
  "The Comet of a season, and I saw",
  "The humblest of all sepulchres, and gazed",
  "  With not the less of sorrow and of awe",
  "On that neglected turf and quiet stone,",
  "With name no clearer than the names unknown,",

  "  The Gardener of that ground, why it might be",
  "That for this plant strangers his memory tasked,",
  "  Through the thick deaths of half a century;",

  "Why frequent travellers turn to pilgrims so;",
  "He died before my day of Sextonship,",

  "You wot, who lies in this selected tomb,",
  "Was a most famous writer in his day,",
  "And therefore travellers step from out their way",

  "  From out my pocket's avaricious nook",
  "Some certain coins of silver, which as 'twere",
  "Perforce I gave this man, though I could spare",
  "So much but inconveniently:--Ye smile,",
  "I see ye, ye profane ones! all the while,",
  "Because my homely phrase the truth would tell.",
  "You are the fools, not I--for I did dwell",
  "With a deep thought, and with a softened eye,",
  "On that old Sexton's natural homily,",
  "In which there was Obscurity and Fame,--",
  "The Glory and the Nothing of a Name.",
