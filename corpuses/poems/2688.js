  "There didst thou love to linger out the day",
  "Loitering beneath the laurels barren shade.",
  "SPIRIT of SPENSER! was the wanderer wrong?",
  "This little picture was for ornament",
  "Design'd, to shine amid the motley mob",
  "Of Fashion and of Folly,--is it not",
  "More honour'd by this solitary song?",
