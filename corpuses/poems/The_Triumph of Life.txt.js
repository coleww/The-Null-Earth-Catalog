  "Mixed in one mighty torrent did appear,",
  "Some flying from the thing they feared, and some",

  "Upon that path where flowers never grew,--",
  "And, weary with vain toil and faint for thirst,",
  "Heard not the fountains, whose melodious dew",
  "",
  "Out of their mossy cells forever burst;",
  "Nor felt the breeze which from the forest told",
  "Of grassy paths and wood-lawns interspersed",
  "",
  "With overarching elms and caverns cold,",
  "And violet banks where sweet dreams brood, but they",
  "Pursued their serious folly as of old.",
  "",
  "And as I gazed, methought that in the way",

  "Doth, as the herald of its coming, bear",
  "The ghost of its dead mother, whose dim form",
  "Bends in dark aether from her infant's chair,--",

  "So came a chariot on the silent storm",
  "Of its own rushing splendour, and a Shape",

  "Beneath a dusky hood and double cape,",

  "Kindle invisibly--and as they glow,",

  "Is spent upon the desert shore;--behind,",
  "Old men and women foully disarrayed,",
  "Shake their gray hairs in the insulting wind,",
  "",
  "And follow in the dance, with limbs decayed,",

  "That what I thought was an old root which grew",
  "To strange distortion out of the hill side,",

  "Were or had been eyes:--'If thou canst forbear",

  "",
  "'Without the opportunity which bore",
  "Him on its eagle pinions to the peak",

  "'Fallen, as Napoleon fell.'--I felt my cheek",
  "Alter, to see the shadow pass away,",

  "That every pigmy kicked it as it lay;",

  "'Like this harsh world in which I woke to weep,",
  "I know not. I arose, and for a space",
  "The scene of woods and waters seemed to keep,",
  "",
  "Though it was now broad day, a gentle trace",
  "Of light diviner than the common sun",
  "Sheds on the common earth, and all the place",
  "",
  "'Was filled with magic sounds woven into one",
  "Oblivious melody, confusing sense",
  "Amid the gliding waves and shadows dun;",

  "'And, as I looked, the bright omnipresence",
  "Of morning through the orient cavern flowed,",
  "And the sun's image radiantly intense",
  "",
  "'Burned on the waters of the well that glowed",
  "Like gold, and threaded all the forest's maze",

  "'Head under the dark boughs, till like a willow",

  "'As one enamoured is upborne in dream",

  "'Partly to tread the waves with feet which kissed",

  "'Leaves his stamp visibly upon the shore,",
