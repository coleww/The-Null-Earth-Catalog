  "And earnest to explore within--around--",
  "The divine wood, whose thick green living woof",
  "Tempered the young day to the sight--I wound",
  "",
  "Up the green slope, beneath the forest's roof,",
  "With slow, soft steps leaving the mountain's steep,",
  "And sought those inmost labyrinths, motion-proof",
  "",
  "Against the air, that in that stillness deep",
  "And solemn, struck upon my forehead bare,",
  "The slow, soft stroke of a continuous...",
  "",
  "In which the ... leaves tremblingly were",
  "All bent towards that part where earliest",
  "The sacred hill obscures the morning air.",
  "",
  "Yet were they not so shaken from the rest,",
  "But that the birds, perched on the utmost spray,",
  "Incessantly renewing their blithe quest,",
  "",
  "With perfect joy received the early day,",
  "Singing within the glancing leaves, whose sound",
  "Kept a low burden to their roundelay,",
  "",
  "Such as from bough to bough gathers around",
  "The pine forest on bleak Chiassi's shore,",
  "When Aeolus Sirocco has unbound.",

  "My slow steps had already borne me o'er",
  "Such space within the antique wood, that I",

  "Upon its bank, impeded suddenly",

  "My going on. Water of purest hue",
  "On earth, would appear turbid and impure",
  "Compared with this, whose unconcealing dew,",
  "",
  "Dark, dark, yet clear, moved under the obscure",
  "Eternal shades, whose interwoven looms",
  "The rays of moon or sunlight ne'er endure.",
  "",
  "I moved not with my feet, but mid the glooms",
  "Pierced with my charmed eye, contemplating",
  "The mighty multitude of fresh May blooms",
  "",
  "Which starred that night, when, even as a thing",
  "That suddenly, for blank astonishment,",
  "Charms every sense, and makes all thought take wing,--",
  "",
  "A solitary woman! and she went",
  "Singing and gathering flower after flower,",
  "With which her way was painted and besprent.",

  "'Bright lady, who, if looks had ever power",
  "To bear true witness of the heart within,",
  "Dost bask under the beams of love, come lower",
  "",
  "Towards this bank. I prithee let me win",
  "This much of thee, to come, that I may hear",
  "Thy song: like Proserpine, in Enna's glen,",
  "",
  "Thou seemest to my fancy, singing here",
  "And gathering flowers, as that fair maiden when",
  "She lost the Spring, and Ceres her, more dear.",
