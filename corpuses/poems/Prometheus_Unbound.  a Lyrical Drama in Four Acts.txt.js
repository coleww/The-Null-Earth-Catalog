  "With fear and self-contempt and barren hope.",
  "Whilst me, who am thy foe, eyeless in hate,",

  "His beak in poison not his own, tears up",
  "My heart; and shapeless sights come wandering by,",
  "The ghastly people of the realm of dream,",
  "Mocking me: and the Earthquake-fiends are charged",
  "To wrench the rivets from my quivering wounds",
  "When the rocks split and close again behind:",

  "Which vibrated to hear me, and then crept",
  "Shuddering through India! Thou serenest Air,",
  "Through which the Sun walks burning without beams!",
  "And ye swift Whirlwinds, who on poised wings",
  "Hung mute and moveless o'er yon hushed abyss,",
  "As thunder, louder than your own, made rock",
  "The orbed world! If then my words had power,",

  "And had run mute, 'mid shrieks of slaughter,",
  "Thro' a city and a solitude.",
  "",
  "THIRD VOICE (FROM THE AIR):",
  "I had clothed, since Earth uprose,",
  "Its wastes in colours not their own,",
  "And oft had my serene repose",
  "Been cloven by many a rending groan.",
  "",
  "FOURTH VOICE (FROM THE WHIRLWINDS):",

  "SECOND VOICE:",

  "And died as mad as the wild waves be.",
  "",
  "THIRD VOICE:",
  "By such dread words from Earth to Heaven",
  "My still realm was never riven:",
  "When its wound was closed, there stood",
  "Darkness o'er the day like blood.",
  "",
  "FOURTH VOICE:",
  "And we shrank back: for dreams of ruin",

  "THE EARTH:",
  "The tongueless caverns of the craggy hills",

  "And the pale nations heard it, 'Misery!'",
  "",
  "PROMETHEUS:",
  "I hear a sound of voices: not the voice",
  "Which I gave forth. Mother, thy sons and thou",
  "Scorn him, without whose all-enduring will",
  "Beneath the fierce omnipotence of Jove,",
  "Both they and thou had vanished, like thin mist",

  "",
  "THE EARTH:",
  "I am the Earth,",
  "Thy mother; she within whose stony veins,",

  "When thou didst from her bosom, like a cloud",
  "Of glory, arise, a spirit of keen joy!",
  "And at thy voice her pining sons uplifted",
  "Their prostrate brows from the polluting dust,",
  "And our almighty Tyrant with fierce dread",
  "Grew pale, until his thunder chained thee here.",
  "Then, see those million worlds which burn and roll",
  "Around us: their inhabitants beheld",
  "My sphered light wane in wide Heaven; the sea",
  "Was lifted by strange tempest, and new fire",
  "From earthquake-rifted mountains of bright snow",
  "Shook its portentous hair beneath Heaven's frown;",
  "Lightning and Inundation vexed the plains;",
  "Blue thistles bloomed in cities; foodless toads",
  "Within voluptuous chambers panting crawled:",
  "When Plague had fallen on man, and beast, and worm,",
  "And Famine; and black blight on herb and tree;",
  "And in the corn, and vines, and meadow-grass,",
  "Teemed ineradicable poisonous weeds",
  "Draining their growth, for my wan breast was dry",
  "With grief; and the thin air, my breath, was stained",
  "With the contagion of a mother's hate",
  "Breathed on her child's destroyer; ay, I heard",
  "Thy curse, the which, if thou rememberest not,",
  "Yet my innumerable seas and streams,",
  "Mountains, and caves, and winds, and yon wide air,",
  "And the inarticulate people of the dead,",

  "For know there are two worlds of life and death:",
  "One that which thou beholdest; but the other",
  "Is underneath the grave, where do inhabit",
  "The shadows of all forms that think and live",
  "Till death unite them and they part no more;",

  "PHANTASM OF JUPITER:",
