  "Swarmed overseas, and harried what was left.",
  "And so there grew great tracts of wilderness,",

  "And after him King Uther fought and died,",
  "But either failed to make the kingdom one.",
  "And after these King Arthur for a space,",
  "And through the puissance of his Table Round,",
  "Drew all their petty princedoms under him.",
  "Their king and head, and made a realm, and reigned.",
  "",
  "And thus the land of Cameliard was waste,",

  "To human sucklings; and the children, housed",
  "In her foul den, there at their meat would growl,",

  "Worse than the wolves. And King Leodogran",
  "Groaned for the Roman legions here again,",
  "And Csar's eagle: then his brother king,",
  "Urien, assailed him: last a heathen horde,",
  "Reddening the sun with smoke and earth with blood,",
  "And on the spike that split the mother's heart",
  "Spitting the child, brake on him, till, amazed,",
  "He knew not whither he should turn for aid.",
  "",
  "But--for he heard of Arthur newly crowned,",

  "The golden symbol of his kinglihood,",
  "But rode a simple knight among his knights,",
  "And many of these in richer arms than he,",
  "She saw him not, or marked not, if she saw,",
  "One among many, though his face was bare.",
  "But Arthur, looking downward as he past,",
  "Felt the light of her eyes into his life",
  "Smite on the sudden, yet rode on, and pitched",
  "His tents beside the forest. Then he drave",
  "The heathen; after, slew the beast, and felled",
  "The forest, letting in the sun, and made",
  "Broad pathways for the hunter and the knight",

  "Are like to those of Uther whom we knew.",
  "This is the son of Gorlos, not the King;",
  "This is the son of Anton, not the King.'",
  "",
  "And Arthur, passing thence to battle, felt",
  "Travail, and throes and agonies of the life,",
  "Desiring to be joined with Guinevere;",
  "And thinking as he rode, `Her father said",
  "That there between the man and beast they die.",
  "Shall I not lift her from this land of beasts",
  "Up to my throne, and side by side with me?",
  "What happiness to reign a lonely king,",
  "Vext--O ye stars that shudder over me,",
  "O earth that soundest hollow under me,",
  "Vext with waste dreams? for saving I be joined",
  "To her that is the fairest under heaven,",
  "I seem as nothing in the mighty world,",
  "And cannot will my will, nor work my work",
  "Wholly, nor make myself in mine own realm",
  "Victor and lord. But were I joined with her,",
  "Then might we live together as one life,",
  "And reigning with one will in everything",
  "Have power on this dark land to lighten it,",
  "And power on this dead world to make it live.'",
  "",
  "Thereafter--as he speaks who tells the tale--",
  "When Arthur reached a field-of-battle bright",
  "With pitched pavilions of his foe, the world",

  "The smallest rock far on the faintest hill,",
  "And even in high day the morning star.",
  "So when the King had set his banner broad,",
  "At once from either side, with trumpet-blast,",
  "And shouts, and clarions shrilling unto blood,",
  "The long-lanced battle let their horses run.",
  "And now the Barons and the kings prevailed,",
  "And now the King, as here and there that war",
  "Went swaying; but the Powers who walk the world",
  "Made lightnings and great thunders over him,",
  "And dazed all eyes, till Arthur by main might,",
  "And mightier of his hands with every blow,",
  "And leading all his knighthood threw the kings",
  "Cardos, Urien, Cradlemont of Wales,",
  "Claudias, and Clariance of Northumberland,",
  "The King Brandagoras of Latangor,",
  "With Anguisant of Erin, Morganore,",
  "And Lot of Orkney. Then, before a voice",
  "As dreadful as the shout of one who sees",
  "To one who sins, and deems himself alone",
  "And all the world asleep, they swerved and brake",
  "Flying, and Arthur called to stay the brands",
  "That hacked among the flyers, `Ho! they yield!'",
  "So like a painted battle the war stood",
  "Silenced, the living quiet as the dead,",
  "And in the heart of Arthur joy was lord.",
  "He laughed upon his warrior whom he loved",
  "And honoured most. `Thou dost not doubt me King,",
  "So well thine arm hath wrought for me today.'",
  "`Sir and my liege,' he cried, `the fire of God",
  "Descends upon thee in the battle-field:",
  "I know thee for my King!' Whereat the two,",
  "For each had warded either in the fight,",

  "",
  "Then quickly from the foughten field he sent",
  "Ulfius, and Brastias, and Bedivere,",
  "His new-made knights, to King Leodogran,",
  "Saying, `If I in aught have served thee well,",
  "Give me thy daughter Guinevere to wife.'",
  "",
  "Whom when he heard, Leodogran in heart",
  "Debating--`How should I that am a king,",
  "However much he holp me at my need,",
  "Give my one daughter saving to a king,",
  "And a king's son?'--lifted his voice, and called",
  "A hoary man, his chamberlain, to whom",
  "He trusted all things, and of him required",
  "His counsel: `Knowest thou aught of Arthur's birth?'",
  "",
  "Then spake the hoary chamberlain and said,",
  "`Sir King, there be but two old men that know:",
  "And each is twice as old as I; and one",
  "Is Merlin, the wise man that ever served",
  "King Uther through his magic art; and one",
  "Is Merlin's master (so they call him) Bleys,",
  "Who taught him magic, but the scholar ran",
  "Before the master, and so far, that Bleys,",
  "Laid magic by, and sat him down, and wrote",
  "All things and whatsoever Merlin did",
  "In one great annal-book, where after-years",
  "Will learn the secret of our Arthur's birth.'",
  "",
  "To whom the King Leodogran replied,",
  "`O friend, had I been holpen half as well",
  "By this King Arthur as by thee today,",
  "Then beast and man had had their share of me:",
  "But summon here before us yet once more",
  "Ulfius, and Brastias, and Bedivere.'",
  "",
  "Then, when they came before him, the King said,",
  "`I have seen the cuckoo chased by lesser fowl,",
  "And reason in the chase: but wherefore now",
  "Do these your lords stir up the heat of war,",
  "Some calling Arthur born of Gorlos,",
  "Others of Anton? Tell me, ye yourselves,",
  "Hold ye this Arthur for King Uther's son?'",
  "",
  "And Ulfius and Brastias answered, `Ay.'",
  "Then Bedivere, the first of all his knights",
  "Knighted by Arthur at his crowning, spake--",
  "For bold in heart and act and word was he,",
  "Whenever slander breathed against the King--",
  "",
  "`Sir, there be many rumours on this head:",
  "For there be those who hate him in their hearts,",
  "Call him baseborn, and since his ways are sweet,",
  "And theirs are bestial, hold him less than man:",
  "And there be those who deem him more than man,",
  "And dream he dropt from heaven: but my belief",
  "In all this matter--so ye care to learn--",
  "Sir, for ye know that in King Uther's time",
  "The prince and warrior Gorlos, he that held",
  "Tintagil castle by the Cornish sea,",
  "Was wedded with a winsome wife, Ygerne:",
  "And daughters had she borne him,--one whereof,",
  "Lot's wife, the Queen of Orkney, Bellicent,",
  "Hath ever like a loyal sister cleaved",
  "To Arthur,--but a son she had not borne.",
  "And Uther cast upon her eyes of love:",
  "But she, a stainless wife to Gorlos,",
  "So loathed the bright dishonour of his love,",
  "That Gorlos and King Uther went to war:",
  "And overthrown was Gorlos and slain.",
  "Then Uther in his wrath and heat besieged",
  "Ygerne within Tintagil, where her men,",
  "Seeing the mighty swarm about their walls,",
  "Left her and fled, and Uther entered in,",
  "And there was none to call to but himself.",
  "So, compassed by the power of the King,",
  "Enforced was she to wed him in her tears,",
  "And with a shameful swiftness: afterward,",
  "Not many moons, King Uther died himself,",
  "Moaning and wailing for an heir to rule",
  "After him, lest the realm should go to wrack.",
  "And that same night, the night of the new year,",
  "By reason of the bitterness and grief",
  "That vext his mother, all before his time",
  "Was Arthur born, and all as soon as born",
  "Delivered at a secret postern-gate",
  "To Merlin, to be holden far apart",
  "Until his hour should come; because the lords",
  "Of that fierce day were as the lords of this,",
  "Wild beasts, and surely would have torn the child",
  "Piecemeal among them, had they known; for each",
  "But sought to rule for his own self and hand,",
  "And many hated Uther for the sake",
  "Of Gorlos. Wherefore Merlin took the child,",
  "And gave him to Sir Anton, an old knight",
  "And ancient friend of Uther; and his wife",
  "Nursed the young prince, and reared him with her own;",
  "And no man knew. And ever since the lords",
  "Have foughten like wild beasts among themselves,",
  "So that the realm has gone to wrack: but now,",
  "This year, when Merlin (for his hour had come)",
  "Brought Arthur forth, and set him in the hall,",
  "Proclaiming, \"Here is Uther's heir, your king,\"",
  "A hundred voices cried, \"Away with him!",
  "No king of ours! a son of Gorlos he,",
  "Or else the child of Anton, and no king,",
  "Or else baseborn.\" Yet Merlin through his craft,",
  "And while the people clamoured for a king,",
  "Had Arthur crowned; but after, the great lords",
  "Banded, and so brake out in open war.'",
  "",
  "Then while the King debated with himself",

  "Or Uther's son, and born before his time,",

  "Said by these three, there came to Cameliard,",
  "With Gawain and young Modred, her two sons,",
  "Lot's wife, the Queen of Orkney, Bellicent;",
  "Whom as he could, not as he would, the King",

  "`A doubtful throne is ice on summer seas.",

  "Hath body enow to hold his foemen down?'",
  "",
  "`O King,' she cried, `and I will tell thee: few,",
  "Few, but all brave, all of one mind with him;",

  "Of Uther's peerage died, and Arthur sat",
  "Crowned on the das, and his warriors cried,",
  "\"Be thou the king, and we will work thy will",
  "Who love thee.\" Then the King in low deep tones,",
  "And simple words of great authority,",
  "Bound them by so strait vows to his own self,",
  "That when they rose, knighted from kneeling, some",

  "`But when he spake and cheered his Table Round",

  "Of incense curled about her, and her face",
  "Wellnigh was hidden in the minster gloom;",
  "But there was heard among the holy hymns",
  "A voice as of the waters, for she dwells",
  "Down in a deep; calm, whatsoever storms",
  "May shake the world, and when the surface rolls,",
  "Hath power to walk the waters like our Lord.",
  "",
  "`There likewise I beheld Excalibur",
  "Before him at his crowning borne, the sword",
  "That rose from out the bosom of the lake,",

  "A dragon winged, and all from stern to stern",
  "Bright with a shining people on the decks,",

  "Dropt to the cove, and watched the great sea fall,",
  "Wave after wave, each mightier than the last,",
  "Till last, a ninth one, gathering half the deep",
  "And full of voices, slowly rose and plunged",
  "Roaring, and all the wave was in a flame:",
  "And down the wave and in the flame was borne",
  "A naked babe, and rode to Merlin's feet,",
  "Who stoopt and caught the babe, and cried \"The King!",
  "Here is an heir for Uther!\" And the fringe",
  "Of that great breaker, sweeping up the strand,",
  "Lashed at the wizard as he spake the word,",
  "And all at once all round him rose in fire,",
  "So that the child and he were clothed in fire.",
  "And presently thereafter followed calm,",
  "Free sky and stars: \"And this the same child,\" he said,",
  "\"Is he who reigns; nor could I part in peace",
  "Till this were told.\" And saying this the seer",
  "Went through the strait and dreadful pass of death,",
  "Not ever to be questioned any more",
  "Save on the further side; but when I met",
  "Merlin, and asked him if these things were truth--",
  "The shining dragon and the naked child",
  "Descending in the glory of the seas--",
  "He laughed as is his wont, and answered me",
  "In riddling triplets of old time, and said:",
  "",
  "`\"Rain, rain, and sun! a rainbow in the sky!",

  "No son of Uther, and no king of ours;'",
  "Till with a wink his dream was changed, the haze",
  "Descended, and the solid earth became",
  "As nothing, but the King stood out in heaven,",

  "Then Arthur charged his warrior whom he loved",
  "And honoured most, Sir Lancelot, to ride forth",

  "Rolled incense, and there past along the hymns",
  "A voice as of the waters, while the two",
  "Sware at the shrine of Christ a deathless love:",
  "And Arthur said, `Behold, thy doom is mine.",
  "Let chance what will, I love thee to the death!'",
