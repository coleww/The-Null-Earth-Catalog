  "After a taper; and the midnight sky",
  "Flares, a light more dread than obscurity.",

  "'Tis the tempestuous loveliness of terror;",
  "For from the serpents gleams a brazen glare",
  "Kindled by that inextricable error,",
  "Which makes a thrilling vapour of the air",
  "Become a ... and ever-shifting mirror",
  "Of all the beauty and the terror there--",
  "A woman's countenance, with serpent-locks,",
  "Gazing in death on Heaven from those wet rocks.",
