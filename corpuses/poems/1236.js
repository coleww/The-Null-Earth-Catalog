  "As to me, I know of nothing else but miracles,",
  "Whether I walk the streets of Manhattan,",
  "Or dart my sight over the roofs of houses toward the sky,",
  "Or wade with naked feet along the beach, just in the edge of the water,",
  "Or stand under trees in the woods,",
  "Or talk by day with any one I love—or sleep in the bed at night with any one I love,",
  "Or sit at table at dinner with my mother,",
  "Or look at strangers opposite me riding in the car,",
  "Or watch honey-bees busy around the hive, of a summer forenoon,",
  "Or animals feeding in the fields,",
  "Or birds—or the wonderfulness of insects in the air,",
  "Or the wonderfulness of the sun-down—or of stars shining so quiet and bright,",
  "Or the exquisite, delicate, thin curve of the new moon in spring;",
  "Or whether I go among those I like best, and that like me best—mechanics, boatmen,",
  "  farmers,",
  "Or among the savans—or to the soiree—or to the opera,",
  "Or stand a long while looking at the movements of machinery,",
  "Or behold children at their sports,",
  "Or the admirable sight of the perfect old man, or the perfect old woman,",
