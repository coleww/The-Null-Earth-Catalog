  "Chapter I.",
  "",
  "Once on a time, a Dawn, all red and bright",
  "Leapt on the conquered ramparts of the Night,",
  "And flamed, one brilliant instant, on the world,",
  "Then back into the historic moat was hurled",
  "And Night was King again, for many years.",
  "-- Once on a time the Rose of Spring blushed out",
  "But Winter angrily withdrew it back",
  "Into his rough new-bursten husk, and shut",
  "The stern husk-leaves, and hid it many years.",
  "-- Once Famine tricked himself with ears of corn,",
  "And Hate strung flowers on his spiked belt,",
  "And glum Revenge in silver lilies pranked him,",
  "And Lust put violets on his shameless front,",
  "And all minced forth o' the street like holiday folk",
  "That sally off afield on Summer morns.",
  "-- Once certain hounds that knew of many a chase,",
  "And bare great wounds of antler and of tusk",
  "That they had ta'en to give a lord some sport,",
  "-- Good hounds, that would have died to give lords sport --",
  "Were so bewrayed and kicked by these same lords",
  "That all the pack turned tooth o' the knights and bit",
  "As knights had been no better things than boars,",
  "And took revenge as bloody as a man's,",
  "Unhoundlike, sudden, hot i' the chops, and sweet.",
  "-- Once sat a falcon on a lady's wrist,",
  "Seeming to doze, with wrinkled eye-lid drawn,",
  "But dreaming hard of hoods and slaveries",
  "And of dim hungers in his heart and wings.",
  "Then, while the mistress gazed above for game,",
  "Sudden he flew into her painted face",
  "And hooked his horn-claws in her lily throat",
  "And drove his beak into her lips and eyes",
  "In fierce and hawkish kissing that did scar",
  "And mar the lady's beauty evermore.",
  "-- And once while Chivalry stood tall and lithe",
  "And flashed his sword above the stricken eyes",
  "Of all the simple peasant-folk of France:",
  "While Thought was keen and hot and quick,",
  "And did not play, as in these later days,",
  "Like summer-lightning flickering in the west",
  "-- As little dreadful as if glow-worms lay",
  "In the cool and watery clouds and glimmered weak --",
  "But gleamed and struck at once or oak or man,",
  "And left not space for Time to wave his wing",
  "Betwixt the instantaneous flash and stroke:",
  "While yet the needs of life were brave and fierce",
  "And did not hide their deeds behind their words,",
  "And logic came not 'twixt desire and act,",
  "And Want-and-Take was the whole Form of life:",
  "While Love had fires a-burning in his veins,",
  "And hidden Hate could flash into revenge:",
  "Ere yet young Trade was 'ware of his big thews",
  "Or dreamed that in the bolder afterdays",
  "He would hew down and bind old Chivalry",
  "And drag him to the highest height of fame",
  "And plunge him thence in the sea of still Romance",
  "To lie for aye in never-rusted mail",
  "Gleaming through quiet ripples of soft songs",
  "And sheens of old traditionary tales; --",
  "On such a time, a certain May arose",
  "From out that blue Sea that between five lands",
  "Lies like a violet midst of five large leaves,",
  "Arose from out this violet and flew on",
  "And stirred the spirits of the woods of France",
  "And smoothed the brows of moody Auvergne hills,",
  "And wrought warm sea-tints into maidens' eyes,",
  "And calmed the wordy air of market-towns",
  "With faint suggestions blown from distant buds,",
  "Until the land seemed a mere dream of land,",
  "And, in this dream-field Life sat like a dove",
  "And cooed across unto her dove-mate Death,",
  "Brooding, pathetic, by a river, lone.",
  "Oh, sharper tangs pierced through this perfumed May.",
  "Strange aches sailed by with odors on the wind",
  "As when we kneel in flowers that grow on graves",
  "Of friends who died unworthy of our love.",
  "King John of France was proving such an ache",
  "In English prisons wide and fair and grand,",
  "Whose long expanses of green park and chace",
  "Did ape large liberty with such success",
  "As smiles of irony ape smiles of love.",
  "Down from the oaks of Hertford Castle park,",
  "Double with warm rose-breaths of southern Spring",
  "Came rumors, as if odors too had thorns,",
  "Sharp rumors, how the three Estates of France,",
  "Like old Three-headed Cerberus of Hell",
  "Had set upon the Duke of Normandy,",
  "Their rightful Regent, snarled in his great face,",
  "Snapped jagged teeth in inch-breadth of his throat,",
  "And blown such hot and savage breath upon him,",
  "That he had tossed great sops of royalty",
  "Unto the clamorous, three-mawed baying beast.",
  "And was not further on his way withal,",
  "And had but changed a snarl into a growl:",
  "How Arnold de Cervolles had ta'en the track",
  "That war had burned along the unhappy land,",
  "Shouting, `since France is then too poor to pay",
  "The soldiers that have bloody devoir done,",
  "And since needs must, pardie! a man must eat,",
  "Arm, gentlemen! swords slice as well as knives!'",
  "And so had tempted stout men from the ranks,",
  "And now was adding robbers' waste to war's,",
  "Stealing the leavings of remorseless battle,",
  "And making gaunter the gaunt bones of want:",
  "How this Cervolles (called \"Arch-priest\" by the mass)",
  "Through warm Provence had marched and menace made",
  "Against Pope Innocent at Avignon,",
  "And how the Pope nor ate nor drank nor slept,",
  "Through godly fear concerning his red wines.",
  "For if these knaves should sack his holy house",
  "And all the blessed casks be knocked o' the head,",
  "HORRENDUM! all his Holiness' drink to be",
  "Profanely guzzled down the reeking throats",
  "Of scoundrels, and inflame them on to seize",
  "The massy coffers of the Church's gold,",
  "And steal, mayhap, the carven silver shrine",
  "And all the golden crucifixes? No! --",
  "And so the holy father Pope made stir",
  "And had sent forth a legate to Cervolles,",
  "And treated with him, and made compromise,",
  "And, last, had bidden all the Arch-priest's troop",
  "To come and banquet with him in his house,",
  "Where they did wassail high by night and day",
  "And Father Pope sat at the board and carved",
  "Midst jokes that flowed full greasily,",
  "And priest and soldier trolled good songs for mass,",
  "And all the prayers the Priests made were, `pray, drink,'",
  "And all the oaths the Soldiers swore were, `drink!'",
  "Till Mirth sat like a jaunty postillon",
  "Upon the back of Time and urged him on",
  "With piquant spur, past chapel and past cross:",
  "How Charles, King of Navarre, in long duress",
  "By mandate of King John within the walls",
  "Of Crevacoeur and then of strong Alleres,",
  "In faithful ward of Sir Tristan du Bois,",
  "Was now escaped, had supped with Guy Kyrec,",
  "Had now a pardon of the Regent Duke",
  "By half compulsion of a Paris mob,",
  "Had turned the people's love upon himself",
  "By smooth harangues, and now was bold to claim",
  "That France was not the Kingdom of King John,",
  "But, By our Lady, his, by right and worth,",
  "And so was plotting treason in the State,",
  "And laughing at weak Charles of Normandy.",
  "Nay, these had been like good news to the King,",
  "Were any man but bold enough to tell",
  "The King what [bitter] sayings men had made",
  "And hawked augmenting up and down the land",
  "Against the barons and great lords of France",
  "That fled from English arrows at Poictiers.",
  "POICTIERS, POICTIERS: this grain i' the eye of France",
  "Had swelled it to a big and bloodshot ball",
  "That looked with rage upon a world askew.",
  "Poictiers' disgrace was now but two years old,",
  "Yet so outrageous rank and full was grown",
  "That France was wholly overspread with shade,",
  "And bitter fruits lay on the untilled ground",
  "That stank and bred so foul contagious smells",
  "That not a nose in France but stood awry,",
  "Nor boor that cried not FAUGH! upon the air.",

  "Chapter II.",
  "",
  "Franciscan friar John de Rochetaillade",
  "With gentle gesture lifted up his hand",
  "And poised it high above the steady eyes",
  "Of a great crowd that thronged the market-place",
  "In fair Clermont to hear him prophesy.",
  "Midst of the crowd old Gris Grillon, the maimed,",
  "-- A wretched wreck that fate had floated out",
  "From the drear storm of battle at Poictiers.",
  "A living man whose larger moiety",
  "Was dead and buried on the battle-field --",
  "A grisly trunk, without or arms or legs,",
  "And scarred with hoof-cuts over cheek and brow,",
  "Lay in his wicker-cradle, smiling.",
  "\"Jacques,\"",
  "Quoth he, \"My son, I would behold this priest",
  "That is not fat, and loves not wine, and fasts,",
  "And stills the folk with waving of his hand,",
  "And threats the knights and thunders at the Pope.",
  "Make way for Gris, ye who are whole of limb!",
  "Set me on yonder ledge, that I may see.\"",
  "Forthwith a dozen horny hands reached out",
  "And lifted Gris Grillon upon the ledge,",
  "Whereon he lay and overlooked the crowd,",
  "And from the gray-grown hedges of his brows",
  "Shot forth a glance against the friar's eye",
  "That struck him like an arrow.",
  "Then the friar,",
  "With voice as low as if a maiden hummed",
  "Love-songs of Provence in a mild day-dream:",
  "\"And when he broke the second seal, I heard",
  "The second beast say, Come and see.",
  "And then",
  "Went out another horse, and he was red.",
  "And unto him that sat thereon was given",
  "To take the peace of earth away, and set",
  "Men killing one another: and they gave",
  "To him a mighty sword.\"",
  "The friar paused",
  "And pointed round the circle of sad eyes.",
  "\"There is no face of man or woman here",
  "But showeth print of the hard hoof of war.",
  "Ah, yonder leaneth limbless Gris Grillon.",
  "Friends, Gris Grillon is France.",
  "Good France; my France,",
  "Wilt never walk on glory's hills again?",
  "Wilt never work among thy vines again?",
  "Art footless and art handless evermore?",
  "-- Thou felon, War, I do arraign thee now",
  "Of mayhem of the four main limbs of France!",
  "Thou old red criminal, stand forth; I charge",
  "-- But O, I am too utter sorrowful",
  "To urge large accusation now.",
  "Nathless,",
  "My work to-day, is still more grievous. Hear!",
  "The stains that war hath wrought upon the land",
  "Show but as faint white flecks, if seen o' the side",
  "Of those blood-covered images that stalk",
  "Through yon cold chambers of the future, as",
  "The prophet-mood, now stealing on my soul,",
  "Reveals them, marching, marching, marching. See!",
  "There go the kings of France, in piteous file.",
  "The deadly diamonds shining in their crowns",
  "Do wound the foreheads of their Majesties",
  "And glitter through a setting of blood-gouts",
  "As if they smiled to think how men are slain",
  "By the sharp facets of the gem of power,",
  "And how the kings of men are slaves of stones.",
  "But look! The long procession of the kings",
  "Wavers and stops; the world is full of noise,",
  "The ragged peoples storm the palaces,",
  "They rave, they laugh, they thirst, they lap the stream",
  "That trickles from the regal vestments down,",
  "And, lapping, smack their heated chaps for more,",
  "And ply their daggers for it, till the kings",
  "All die and lie in a crooked sprawl of death,",
  "Ungainly, foul, and stiff as any heap",
  "Of villeins rotting on a battle-field.",
  "'Tis true, that when these things have come to pass",
  "Then never a king shall rule again in France,",
  "For every villein shall be king in France:",
  "And who hath lordship in him, whether born",
  "In hedge or silken bed, shall be a lord:",
  "And queens shall be as thick i' the land as wives,",
  "And all the maids shall maids of honor be:",
  "And high and low shall commune solemnly:",
  "And stars and stones shall have free interview.",
  "But woe is me, 'tis also piteous true",
  "That ere this gracious time shall visit France,",
  "Your graves, Beloved, shall be some centuries old,",
  "And so your children's, and their children's graves",
  "And many generations'.",
  "Ye, O ye",
  "Shall grieve, and ye shall grieve, and ye shall grieve.",
  "Your Life shall bend and o'er his shuttle toil,",
  "A weaver weaving at the loom of grief.",
  "Your Life shall sweat 'twixt anvil and hot forge,",
  "An armorer working at the sword of grief.",
  "Your Life shall moil i' the ground, and plant his seed,",
  "A farmer foisoning a huge crop of grief.",
  "Your Life shall chaffer in the market-place,",
  "A merchant trading in the goods of grief.",
  "Your Life shall go to battle with his bow,",
  "A soldier fighting in defence of grief.",
  "By every rudder that divides the seas,",
  "Tall Grief shall stand, the helmsman of the ship.",
  "By every wain that jolts along the roads,",
  "Stout Grief shall walk, the driver of the team.",
  "Midst every herd of cattle on the hills,",
  "Dull Grief shall lie, the herdsman of the drove.",
  "Oh Grief shall grind your bread and play your lutes",
  "And marry you and bury you.",
  "-- How else?",
  "Who's here in France, can win her people's faith",
  "And stand in front and lead the people on?",
  "Where is the Church?",
  "The Church is far too fat.",
  "Not, mark, by robust swelling of the thews,",
  "But puffed and flabby large with gross increase",
  "Of wine-fat, plague-fat, dropsy-fat.",
  "O shame,",
  "Thou Pope that cheatest God at Avignon,",
  "Thou that shouldst be the Father of the world",
  "And Regent of it whilst our God is gone;",
  "Thou that shouldst blaze with conferred majesty",
  "And smite old Lust-o'-the-Flesh so as by flame;",
  "Thou that canst turn thy key and lock Grief up",
  "Or turn thy key and unlock Heaven's Gate,",
  "Thou that shouldst be the veritable hand",
  "That Christ down-stretcheth out of heaven yet",
  "To draw up him that fainteth to His heart,",
  "Thou that shouldst bear thy fruit, yet virgin live,",
  "As she that bore a man yet sinned not,",
  "Thou that shouldst challenge the most special eyes",
  "Of Heaven and Earth and Hell to mark thee, since",
  "Thou shouldst be Heaven's best captain, Earth's best friend,",
  "And Hell's best enemy -- false Pope, false Pope,",
  "The world, thy child, is sick and like to die,",
  "But thou art dinner-drowsy and cannot come:",
  "And Life is sore beset and crieth `help!'",
  "But thou brook'st not disturbance at thy wine:",
  "And France is wild for one to lead her souls;",
  "But thou art huge and fat and laggest back",
  "Among the remnants of forsaken camps.",
  "Thou'rt not God's Pope, thou art the Devil's Pope.",
  "Thou art first Squire to that most puissant knight,",
  "Lord Satan, who thy faithful squireship long",
  "Hath watched and well shall guerdon.",
  "Ye sad souls,",
  "So faint with work ye love not, so thin-worn",
  "With miseries ye wrought not, so outraged",
  "By strokes of ill that pass th' ill-doers' heads",
  "And cleave the innocent, so desperate tired",
  "Of insult that doth day by day abuse",
  "The humblest dignity of humblest men,",
  "Ye cannot call toward the Church for help.",
  "The Church already is o'erworked with care",
  "Of its dyspeptic stomach.",
  "Ha, the Church",
  "Forgets about eternity.",
  "I had",
  "A vision of forgetfulness.",
  "O Dream",
  "Born of a dream, as yonder cloud is born",
  "Of water which is born of cloud!",
  "I thought",
  "I saw the moonlight lying large and calm",
  "Upon the unthrobbing bosom of the earth,",
  "As a great diamond glittering on a shroud.",
  "A sense of breathlessness stilled all the world.",
  "Motion stood dreaming he was changed to Rest,",
  "And Life asleep did fancy he was Death.",
  "A quick small shadow spotted the white world;",
  "Then instantly 'twas huge, and huger grew",
  "By instants till it did o'ergloom all space.",
  "I lifted up mine eyes -- O thou just God!",
  "I saw a spectre with a million heads",
  "Come frantic downward through the universe,",
  "And all the mouths of it were uttering cries,",
  "Wherein was a sharp agony, and yet",
  "The cries were much like laughs: as if Pain laughed.",
  "Its myriad lips were blue, and sometimes they",
  "Closed fast and only moaned dim sounds that shaped",
  "Themselves to one word, `Homeless', and the stars",
  "Did utter back the moan, and the great hills",
  "Did bellow it, and then the stars and hills",
  "Bandied the grief o' the ghost 'twixt heaven and earth.",
  "The spectre sank, and lay upon the air,",
  "And brooded, level, close upon the earth,",
  "With all the myriad heads just over me.",
  "I glanced in all the eyes and marked that some",
  "Did glitter with a flame of lunacy,",
  "And some were soft and false as feigning love,",
  "And some were blinking with hypocrisy,",
  "And some were overfilmed by sense, and some",
  "Blazed with ambition's wild, unsteady fire,",
  "And some were burnt i' the sockets black, and some",
  "Were dead as embers when the fire is out.",
  "A curious zone circled the Spectre's waist,",
  "Which seemed with strange device to symbol Time.",
  "It was a silver-gleaming thread of day",
  "Spiral about a jet-black band of night.",
  "This zone seemed ever to contract and all",
  "The frame with momentary spasms heaved",
  "In the strangling traction which did never cease.",
  "I cried unto the spectre, `Time hath bound",
  "Thy body with the fibre of his hours.'",
  "Then rose a multitude of mocking sounds,",
  "And some mouths spat at me and cried `thou fool',",
  "And some, `thou liest', and some, `he dreams': and then",
  "Some hands uplifted certain bowls they bore",
  "To lips that writhed but drank with eagerness.",
  "And some played curious viols, shaped like hearts",
  "And stringed with loves, to light and ribald tunes,",
  "And other hands slit throats with knives,",
  "And others patted all the painted cheeks",
  "In reach, and others stole what others had",
  "Unseen, or boldly snatched at alien rights,",
  "And some o' the heads did vie in a foolish game",
  "OF WHICH COULD HOLD ITSELF THE HIGHEST, and",
  "OF WHICH ONE'S NECK WAS STIFF THE LONGEST TIME.",
  "And then the sea in silence wove a veil",
  "Of mist, and breathed it upward and about,",
  "And waved and wound it softly round the world,",
  "And meshed my dream i' the vague and endless folds,",
  "And a light wind arose and blew these off,",
  "And I awoke.",
  "The many heads are priests",
  "That have forgot eternity: and Time",
  "Hath caught and bound them with a withe",
  "Into a fagot huge, to burn in hell.",
  "-- Now if the priesthood put such shame upon",
  "Your cry for leadership, can better help",
  "Come out of knighthood?",
  "Lo! you smile, you boors?",
  "You villeins smile at knighthood?",
  "Now, thou France",
  "That wert the mother of fair chivalry,",
  "Unclose thine eyes, unclose thine eyes, here, see,",
  "Here stand a herd of knaves that laugh to scorn",
  "Thy gentlemen!",
  "O contumely hard,",
  "O bitterness of last disgrace, O sting",
  "That stings the coward knights of lost Poictiers!",
  "I would --\" but now a murmur rose i' the crowd",
  "Of angry voices, and the friar leapt",
  "From where he stood to preach and pressed a path",
  "Betwixt the mass that way the voices came.",

  "Lord Raoul was riding castleward from field.",
  "At left hand rode his lady and at right",
  "His fool whom he loved better; and his bird,",
  "His fine ger-falcon best beloved of all,",
  "Sat hooded on his wrist and gently swayed",
  "To the undulating amble of the horse.",
  "Guest-knights and huntsmen and a noisy train",
  "Of loyal-stomached flatterers and their squires",
  "Clattered in retinue, and aped his pace,",
  "And timed their talk by his, and worked their eyes",
  "By intimation of his glance, with great",

  "-- Fast chained with nothing, firmer than with steel;",
  "-- Captive in limb, yet free in eye and ear,",
  "Sole tenant of this puny Hell in Heaven:",
  "-- And this -- all this -- because I was a man!",
  "For, in the battle -- ha, thou know'st, pale-face!",
  "When that the four great English horsemen bore",
  "So bloodily on thee, I leapt to front",
  "To front of thee -- of thee -- and fought four blades,",

  "Calm with a changing mood, sat still and called:",
  "\"Here, huntsmen, 'tis my will ye seize the hind",

  "Of springy clouds, and bore straight on toward",
  "The Duke. On him her eyes burned steadily",
  "With such gray fires of heaven-hot command",
  "As Dawn burns Night away with, and she held",
  "Her white forefinger quivering aloft",
  "At greatest arm's-length of her dainty arm,",
  "In menace sweeter than a kiss could be",
