  "O MAGNET-SOUTH! O glistening, perfumed South! My South!",
  "O quick mettle, rich blood, impulse, and love! Good and evil! O all dear to me!",
  "O dear to me my birth-things—All moving things, and the trees where I was",
  "    born—the",
  "  grains,",
  "  plants, rivers;",
  "Dear to me my own slow sluggish rivers where they flow, distant, over flats of silvery",
  "    sands,",
  "  or",
  "  through swamps;",
  "Dear to me the Roanoke, the Savannah, the Altamahaw, the Pedee, the Tombigbee, the Santee,",
  "    the",
  "  Coosa, and the Sabine;",
  "O pensive, far away wandering, I return with my Soul to haunt their banks again;",
  "Again in Florida I float on transparent lakes—I float on the Okeechobee—I cross",
  "    the",
  "  hummock land, or through pleasant openings, or dense forests;",
  "I see the parrots in the woods—I see the papaw tree and the blossoming titi;",
  "Again, sailing in my coaster, on deck, I coast off Georgia—I coast up the Carolinas,",
  "I see where the live-oak is growing—I see where the yellow-pine, the scented",
  "    bay-tree, the",
  "  lemon and orange, the cypress, the graceful palmetto;",
  "I pass rude sea-headlands and enter Pamlico Sound through an inlet, and dart my vision",
  "    inland;",
  "O the cotton plant! the growing fields of rice, sugar, hemp!",
  "The cactus, guarded with thorns—the laurel-tree, with large white flowers;",
  "The range afar—the richness and barrenness—the old woods charged with mistletoe",
  "    and",
  "  trailing moss,",
  "The piney odor and the gloom—the awful natural stillness, (Here in these dense swamps",
  "    the",
  "  freebooter carries his gun, and the fugitive slave has his conceal’d hut;)",
  "O the strange fascination of these half-known, half-impassable swamps, infested by",
  "    reptiles,",
  "  resounding with the bellow of the alligator, the sad noises of the night-owl and the",
  "    wild-cat,",
  "  and",
  "  the whirr of the rattlesnake;",
  "The mocking-bird, the American mimic, singing all the forenoon—singing through the",
  "  moon-lit",
  "  night,",
  "The humming-bird, the wild turkey, the raccoon, the opossum;",
  "A Tennessee corn-field—the tall, graceful, long-leav’d corn—slender,",
  "    flapping,",
  "  bright",
  "  green with tassels—with beautiful ears, each well-sheath’d in its husk;",
  "An Arkansas prairie—a sleeping lake, or still bayou;",
  "O my heart! O tender and fierce pangs—I can stand them not—I will depart;",
  "O to be a Virginian, where I grew up! O to be a Carolinian!",
  "O longings irrepressible! O I will go back to old Tennessee, and never wander more!",
