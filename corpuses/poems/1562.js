  "The Sea's faint murmur. In the open air",
  "Our Myrtles blossom'd; and across the porch",
  "Thick Jasmins twined : the little landscape round",
  "Was green and woody, and refresh'd the eye.",
  "It was a spot which you might aptly call",
  "The Valley of Seclusion ! Once I saw",
  "(Hallowing his Sabbath-day by quiteness)",
  "A wealthy son of Commerce saunter by,",
  "Bristowa's citizen : methought, it calm'd",
  "His thirst of idle gold, and made him muse",
  "With wiser feelings : for he paus'd, and look'd",
  "With a pleas'd sadness, and gaz'd all around,",
  "Then eyed our Cottage, and gaz'd round again,",
  "And sigh'd, and said, it was a Blessйd Place.",
  "And we were bless'd. Oft with patient ear",
  "Long-listening to the viewless sky-lark's note",
  "(Viewless, or haply for a moment seen",
  "Gleaming on sunny wings) in whisper'd tones",
  "I said to my Belovйd, `Such, sweet Girl !",

  "The bare bleak mountain speckled thin with sheep ;",
  "Grey clouds, that shadowing spot the sunny fields ;",
  "And river, now with bushy rocks o'er-brow'd,",
  "Now winding bright and full, with naked banks ;",
  "And seats, and lawns, the Abbey and the wood,",
  "And cots, and hamlets, and faint city-spire ;",
  "The Channel there, the Islands and white sails,",
  "Dim coasts, and cloud-like hills, and shoreless Ocean--",
  "It seem'd like Omnipresence ! God, methought,",
  "Had build him there a Temple : the whole World",
  "Seem'd imag'd in its vast circumference :",

  "Ah ! quiet Dell ! dear Cot, and Mount sublime !",
  "I was constrain'd to quit you. Was it right,",

  "That I should dream away the entrusted hours",
  "On rose-leaf beds, pampering the coward heart",
  "With feelings all too delicate for use ?",
  "Sweet is the tear that from some Howard's eye",

  "Who sigh for Wretchedness, yet shun the Wretched,",
  "Nursing in some delicious solitude",
  "Their slothful loves and dainty sympathies !",
  "I therefore go, and join head, heart, and hand,",

  "Yet oft when after honourable toil",
  "Rests the tir'd mind, and waking loves to dream,",
  "My spirit shall revisit thee, dear Cot !",
  "Thy Jasmin and thy window-peeping Rose,",
