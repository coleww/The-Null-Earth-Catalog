  "Hot August noon: already on that day",
  "Since sunrise through the Wiltshire downs, most sad",
  "Of mouth and eye, he had gone leagues of way;",
  "Ay and by night, till whether good or bad",
  "",
  "He was, he knew not, though he knew perchance",
  "That he was Launcelot, the bravest knight",
  "Of all who since the world was, have borne lance,",
  "Or swung their swords in wrong cause or in right.",
  "",
  "Nay, he knew nothing now, except that where",
  "The Glastonbury gilded towers shine,",
  "A lady dwelt, whose name was Guenevere;",
  "This he knew also; that some fingers twine,",
  "",
  "Not only in a man's hair, even his heart,",
  "(Making him good or bad I mean,) but in his life,",
  "Skies, earth, men's looks and deeds, all that has part,",
  "Not being ourselves, in that half-sleep, half-strife,",
  "",
  "(Strange sleep, strange strife,) that men call living; so",
  "Was Launcelot most glad when the moon rose,",
  "Because it brought new memories of her. \"Lo,",
  "Between the trees a large moon, the wind lows",
  "",
  "\"Not loud, but as a cow begins to low,",
  "Wishing for strength to make the herdsman hear:",
  "The ripe corn gathereth dew; yea, long ago,",
  "In the old garden life, my Guenevere",
  "",
  "\"Loved to sit still among the flowers, till night",
  "Had quite come on, hair loosen'd, for she said,",
  "Smiling like heaven, that its fairness might",
  "Draw up the wind sooner to cool her head.",
  "",
  "\"Now while I ride how quick the moon gets small,",
  "As it did then: I tell myself a tale",
  "That will not last beyond the whitewashed wall,",
  "Thoughts of some joust must help me through the vale,",
  "",
  "\"Keep this till after: How Sir Gareth ran",
  "A good course that day under my Queen's eyes,",
  "And how she sway'd laughing at Dinadan.",
  "No. Back again, the other thoughts will rise,",
  "",
  "\"And yet I think so fast 'twill end right soon:",
  "Verily then I think, that Guenevere,",
  "Made sad by dew and wind, and tree-barred moon,",
  "Did love me more than ever, was more dear",
  "",
  "\"To me than ever, she would let me lie",
  "And kiss her feet, or, if I sat behind,",
  "Would drop her hand and arm most tenderly,",
  "And touch my mouth. And she would let me wind",
  "",
  "\"Her hair around my neck, so that it fell",
  "Upon my red robe, strange in the twilight",
  "With many unnamed colours, till the bell",
  "Of her mouth on my cheek sent a delight",
  "",
  "\"Through all my ways of being; like the stroke",
  "Wherewith God threw all men upon the face",
  "When he took Enoch, and when Enoch woke",
  "With a changed body in the happy place.",
  "",
  "\"Once, I remember, as I sat beside,",
  "She turn'd a little, and laid back her head,",
  "And slept upon my breast; I almost died",
  "In those night-watches with my love and dread.",
  "",
  "\"There lily-like she bow'd her head and slept,",
  "And I breathed low, and did not dare to move,",
  "But sat and quiver'd inwardly, thoughts crept,",
  "And frighten'd me with pulses of my Love.",
  "",
  "\"The stars shone out above the doubtful green",
  "Of her bodice, in the green sky overhead;",
  "Pale in the green sky were the stars I ween,",
  "Because the moon shone like a star she shed",
  "",
  "\"When she dwelt up in heaven a while ago,",
  "And ruled all things but God: the night went on,",
  "The wind grew cold, and the white moon grew low,",
  "One hand had fallen down, and now lay on",
  "",
  "\"My cold stiff palm; there were no colours then",
  "For near an hour, and I fell asleep",
  "In spite of all my striving, even when",
  "I held her whose name-letters make me leap.",
  "",
  "\"I did not sleep long, feeling that in sleep",
  "I did some loved one wrong, so that the sun",
  "Had only just arisen from the deep",
  "Still land of colours, when before me one",
  "",
  "\"Stood whom I knew, but scarcely dared to touch,",
  "She seemed to have changed so in the night;",
  "Moreover she held scarlet lilies, such",
  "As Maiden Margaret bears upon the light",
  "",
  "\"Of the great church walls, natheless did I walk",
  "Through the fresh wet woods, and the wheat that morn,",
  "Touching her hair and hand and mouth, and talk",
  "Of love we held, nigh hid among the corn.",
  "",
  "\"Back to the palace, ere the sun grew high,",
  "We went, and in a cool green room all day",
  "I gazed upon the arras giddily,",
  "Where the wind set the silken kings a-sway.",
  "",
  "\"I could not hold her hand, or see her face;",
  "For which may God forgive me! but I think,",
  "Howsoever, that she was not in that place.\"",
  "These memories Launcelot was quick to drink;",
  "",
  "And when these fell, some paces past the wall,",
  "There rose yet others, but they wearied more,",
  "And tasted not so sweet; they did not fall",
  "So soon, but vaguely wrenched his strained heart sore",
  "",
  "In shadowy slipping from his grasp: these gone,",
  "A longing followed; if he might but touch",
  "That Guenevere at once! Still night, the lone",
  "Grey horse's head before him vex'd him much,",
  "",
  "In steady nodding over the grey road:",
  "Still night, and night, and night, and emptied heart",
  "Of any stories; what a dismal load",
  "Time grew at last, yea, when the night did part,",
  "",
  "And let the sun flame over all, still there",
  "The horse's grey ears turn'd this way and that,",
  "And still he watch'd them twitching in the glare",
  "Of the morning sun, behind them still he sat,",
  "",
  "Quite wearied out with all the wretched night,",
  "Until about the dustiest of the day,",
  "On the last down's brow he drew his rein in sight",
  "Of the Glastonbury roofs that choke the way.",
  "",
  "And he was now quite giddy as before,",
  "When she slept by him, tired out, and her hair",
  "Was mingled with the rushes on the floor,",
  "And he, being tired too, was scarce aware",
  "",
  "Of her presence; yet as he sat and gazed,",
  "A shiver ran throughout him, and his breath",
  "Came slower, he seem'd suddenly amazed,",
  "As though he had not heard of Arthur's death.",
  "",
  "This for a moment only, presently",
  "He rode on giddy still, until he reach'd",
  "A place of apple-trees, by the thorn-tree",
  "Wherefrom St. Joseph in the days past preached.",
  "",
  "Dazed there he laid his head upon a tomb,",
  "Not knowing it was Arthur's, at which sight",
  "One of her maidens told her, \"He is come,\"",
  "And she went forth to meet him; yet a blight",
  "",
  "Had settled on her, all her robes were black,",
  "With a long white veil only; she went slow,",
  "As one walks to be slain, her eyes did lack",
  "Half her old glory, yea, alas! the glow",
  "",
  "Had left her face and hands; this was because",
  "As she lay last night on her purple bed,",
  "Wishing for morning, grudging every pause",
  "Of the palace clocks, until that Launcelot's head",
  "",
  "Should lie on her breast, with all her golden hair",
  "Each side: when suddenly the thing grew drear,",
  "In morning twilight, when the grey downs bare",
  "Grew into lumps of sin to Guenevere.",
  "",
  "At first she said no word, but lay quite still,",
  "Only her mouth was open, and her eyes",
  "Gazed wretchedly about from hill to hill;",
  "As though she asked, not with so much surprise",
  "",
  "As tired disgust, what made them stand up there",
  "So cold and grey. After, a spasm took",
  "Her face, and all her frame, she caught her hair,",
  "All her hair, in both hands, terribly she shook,",
  "",
  "And rose till she was sitting in the bed,",
  "Set her teeth hard, and shut her eyes and seem'd",
  "As though she would have torn it from her head,",
  "Natheless she dropp'd it, lay down, as she deem'd",
  "",
  "It matter'd not whatever she might do:",
  "O Lord Christ! pity on her ghastly face!",
  "Those dismal hours while the cloudless blue",
  "Drew the sun higher: He did give her grace;",
  "",
  "Because at last she rose up from her bed,",
  "And put her raiment on, and knelt before",
  "The blessed rood, and with her dry lips said,",
  "Muttering the words against the marble floor:",
  "",
  "\"Unless you pardon, what shall I do, Lord,",
  "But go to hell? and there see day by day",
  "Foul deed on deed, hear foulest word on word,",
  "For ever and ever, such as on the way",
  "",
  "\"To Camelot I heard once from a churl,",
  "That curled me up upon my jennet's neck",
  "With bitter shame; how then, Lord, should I curl",
  "For ages and for ages? dost thou reck",
  "",
  "\"That I am beautiful, Lord, even as you",
  "And your dear mother? why did I forget",
  "You were so beautiful, and good, and true,",
  "That you loved me so, Guenevere? O yet",
  "",
  "\"If even I go to hell, I cannot choose",
  "But love you, Christ, yea, though I cannot keep",
  "From loving Launcelot; O Christ! must I lose",
  "My own heart's love? see, though I cannot weep,",
  "",
  "\"Yet am I very sorry for my sin;",
  "Moreover, Christ, I cannot bear that hell,",
  "I am most fain to love you, and to win",
  "A place in heaven some time: I cannot tell:",
  "",
  "\"Speak to me, Christ! I kiss, kiss, kiss your feet;",
  "Ah! now I weep!\" The maid said, \"By the tomb",
  "He waiteth for you, lady,\" coming fleet,",
  "Not knowing what woe filled up all the room.",
  "",
  "So Guenevere rose and went to meet him there,",
  "He did not hear her coming, as he lay",
  "On Arthur's head, till some of her long hair",
  "Brush'd on the new-cut stone: \"Well done! to pray",

  "God's curses, unto such as I am; not",
  "",
  "\"Ever again shall we twine arms and lips.\"",
  "\"Yea, she is mad: thy heavy law, O Lord,",
  "Is very tight about her now, and grips",
  "Her poor heart, so that no right word",
  "",
  "\"Can reach her mouth; so, Lord, forgive her now,",
  "That she not knowing what she does, being mad,",
  "Kills me in this way: Guenevere, bend low",
  "And kiss me once! for God's love kiss me! sad",
  "",
  "\"Though your face is, you look much kinder now;",

  "",
  "\"Yea, shake! shake now and shiver! if you can",
  "Remember anything for agony,",

  "To meet him, with my ladies, on the stair,",
  "My face made beautiful with my young blood.\"",
  "",
  "\"Will she lie now, Lord God?\" \"Remember too,",
  "Wrung heart, how first before the knights there came",
  "A royal bier, hung round with green and blue,",
  "About it shone great tapers with sick flame.",
  "",
  "\"And thereupon Lucius, the Emperor,",
  "Lay royal-robed, but stone-cold now and dead,",
  "Not able to hold sword or sceptre more,",
  "But not quite grim; because his cloven head",
