  "No sad wing, or hoarse bird of night,",

  "Shall from his wings rain on thy flowers;",
  "And the moon from her dewy locks",
  "Shall deck thee with her brightest drops:",
  "What ever can a fancy move,",
  "Or feed the eye; be on this Grove;",

  "Of Heaven, with the consuming years,",

  "So there again, thou'lt see us move",
  "In our first innocence, and love:",
  "And in thy shades, as now, so then,",
  "We'll kiss, and smile, and walk again.",
