  "When passion's wildest ecstasy",
  "Was coldness to the joys I knew,",
  "When every sorrow sunk away.",

  "That shades the intervening dale.",

  "I seem again to share thy smile,",
  "I seem to hang upon thy tone.",
  "Again you say, 'Confide in me,",
  "For I am thine, and thine alone,",
  "And thine must ever, ever be.'",
  "But oh! awak'ning still anew,",
  "Athwart my enanguished senses flew",
  "A fiercer, deadlier agony!",
