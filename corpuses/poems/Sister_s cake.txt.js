  "I'd not complain of Sister Jane, for she was good and kind,",
  "Combining with rare comeliness distinctive gifts of mind;",
  "Nay, I'll admit it were most fit that, worn by social cares,",
  "She'd crave a change from parlor life to that below the stairs,",
  "And that, eschewing needlework and music, she should take",
  "Herself to the substantial art of manufacturing cake.",
  "",
  "At breakfast, then, it would befall that Sister Jane would say:",
  "\"Mother, if you have got the things, I'll make some cake to-day!\"",
  "Poor mother'd cast a timid glance at father, like as not--",
  "For father hinted sister's cooking cost a frightful lot--",
  "But neither she nor he presumed to signify dissent,",
  "Accepting it for gospel truth that what she wanted went!",
  "",
  "No matter what the rest of 'em might chance to have in hand,",
  "The whole machinery of the house came to a sudden stand;",
  "The pots were hustled off the stove, the fire built up anew,",
  "With every damper set just so to heat the oven through;",
  "The kitchen-table was relieved of everything, to make",
  "That ample space which Jane required when she compounded cake.",
  "",
  "And, oh! the bustling here and there, the flying to and fro;",
  "The click of forks that whipped the eggs to lather white as snow--",
  "And what a wealth of sugar melted swiftly out of sight--",
  "And butter? Mother said such waste would ruin father, quite!",
  "But Sister Jane preserved a mien no pleading could confound",
  "As she utilized the raisins and the citron by the pound.",
  "",
  "Oh, hours of chaos, tumult, heat, vexatious din, and whirl!",
  "Of deep humiliation for the sullen hired-girl;",
  "Of grief for mother, hating to see things wasted so,",
  "And of fortune for that little boy who pined to taste that dough!",
  "It looked so sweet and yellow--sure, to taste it were no sin--",
  "But, oh! how sister scolded if he stuck his finger in!",
  "",
  "The chances were as ten to one, before the job was through,",
  "That sister'd think of something else she'd great deal rather do!",
  "So, then, she'd softly steal away, as Arabs in the night,",
  "Leaving the girl and ma to finish up as best they might;",
  "These tactics (artful Sister Jane) enabled her to take",
  "Or shift the credit or the blame of that too-treacherous cake!",
  "",
  "And yet, unhappy is the man who has no Sister Jane--",
  "For he who has no sister seems to me to live in vain.",
  "I never had a sister--may be that is why today",
  "I'm wizened and dyspeptic, instead of blithe and gay;",
  "A boy who's only forty should be full of romp and mirth,",
  "But I (because I'm sisterless) am the oldest man on earth!",
  "",
  "Had I a little sister--oh, how happy I should be!",
  "I'd never let her cast her eyes on any chap but me;",
  "I'd love her and I'd cherish her for better and for worse--",
  "I'd buy her gowns and bonnets, and sing her praise in verse;",
  "And--yes, what's more and vastly more--I tell you what I'd do:",
  "I'd let her make her wondrous cake, and I would eat it, too!",
  "",
  "I have a high opinion of the sisters, as you see--",
  "Another fellow's sister is so very dear to me!",
  "I love to work anear her when she's making over frocks,",
  "When she patches little trousers or darns prosaic socks;",
  "But I draw the line at one thing--yes, I don my hat and take",
  "A three hours' walk when she is moved to try her hand at cake!",
