  "Sweet solitude, what joy to be alone--",
  "  In wild, wood-shady dell to stay for hours.",
  "Twould soften hearts if they were hard as stone",
  "  To see glad butterflies and smiling flowers.",
  "Tis pleasant in these quiet lonely places,",
  "  Where not the voice of man our pleasure mars,",
  "To see the little bees with coal black faces",
  "  Gathering sweets from little flowers like stars.",
  "",
  "The wind seems calling, though not understood.",
  "  A voice is speaking; hark, it louder calls.",
  "It echoes in the far-outstretching wood.",
  "  First twas a hum, but now it loudly squalls;",
  "And then the pattering rain begins to fall,",
  "  And it is hushed--the fern leaves scarcely shake,",
  "The tottergrass it scarcely stirs at all.",
  "  And then the rolling thunder gets awake,",
  "  And from black clouds the lightning flashes break.",
  "",
  "The sunshine's gone, and now an April evening",
  "  Commences with a dim and mackerel sky.",
  "Gold light and woolpacks in the west are leaving,",
  "  And leaden streaks their splendid place supply.",
  "Sheep ointment seems to daub the dead-hued sky,",
  "  And night shuts up the lightsomeness of day,",
  "All dark and absent as a corpse's eye.",
  "  Flower, tree, and bush, like all the shadows grey,",
  "  In leaden hues of desolation fade away.",
  "",
  "Tis May; and yet the March flower Dandelion",
  "  Is still in bloom among the emerald grass,",
  "Shining like guineas with the sun's warm eye on--",
  "  We almost think they are gold as we pass,",
  "Or fallen stars in a green sea of grass.",
  "  They shine in fields, or waste grounds near the town.",
  "They closed like painter's brush when even was.",
  "  At length they turn to nothing else but down,",
  "  While the rude winds blow off each shadowy crown.",
