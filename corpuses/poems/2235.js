  "No King might ever such a Force have done;",
  "Yet would not he be Lord, nor yet his Son.",
  "Thou with the same strength, and an Heart as plain,",
  "Didst (like thine Olive) still refuse to Reign;",

  "Pleas'd with that other World of moving Light;",
  "But thought him when he miss'd his setting beams,",
  "Sunk in the Hills, or plung'd below the Streams.",

  "Smiling serenely from the further side.",
  "So while our Star that gives us Light and Heat,",
  "Seem'd now a long and gloomy Night to threat,",
