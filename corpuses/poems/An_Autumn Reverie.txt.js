  "Alas! Beautiful Summer now hath fled,",
  "And the face of Nature doth seem dead,",
  "And the leaves are withered, and falling off the trees,",
  "By the nipping and chilling autumnal breeze.",
  "",
  "The pleasures of the little birds are all fled,",
  "And with the cold many of them will be found dead,",
  "Because the leaves of the trees are scattered in the blast,",
  "And makes the feathered creatures feel downcast.",
  "",
  "Because there are no leaves on the trees to shield them from the storm",
  "On a windy, and rainy, cloudy morn;",
  "Which makes their little hearts throb with pain,",
  "By the chilling blast and the pitiless rain.",
  "",
  "But still they are more contented than the children of God,",
  "As long as they can pick up a worm from the sod,",
  "Or anything they can get to eat,",
  "Just, for instance, a stale crust of bread or a grain of wheat.",
  "",
  "Oh! Think of the little birds in the time of the snow,",
  "Also of the little street waifs, that are driven to and fro,",
  "And trembling in the cold blast, and chilled to the bone,",
  "For the want of food and clothing, and a warm home.",
  "",
  "Besides think of the sorrows of the wandering poor,",
  "That are wandering in the cold blast from door to door;",

  "Oh! Think of the working man when he's no work to do,",
  "Who's got a wife and family, perhaps four or two,",
  "And the father searching for work, and no work can be had,",
  "The thought, I'm sure, 'tis enough to drive the poor man mad.",
  "",
  "Because for his wife and family he must feel,",
  "And perhaps the thought thereof will cause him to steal",
  "Bread for his family, that are starving at home,",
  "While the thought thereof makes him sigh heavily and groan.",

  "Alas! The pangs of hunger are very hard to hide,",
  "And few people can their temper control,",
  "Or become reconciled to their fate,",
  "Especially when they cannot find anything to eat.",
  "",
  "Oh! Think of the struggles of the poor to make a living,",
  "Because the rich unto them seldom are giving;",
  "Wereas they are told he that giveth to the poor lendeth unto the Lord,",
  "But alas! they rather incline their money to hoard.",

  "Then theres the little news-vendors in the street,",
  "Running about perhaps with bare feet;",
  "And if the rich chance to see such creatures in the street,",
  "In general they make a sudden retreat.",
