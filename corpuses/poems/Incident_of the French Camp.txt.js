  "On a little mound, Napoleon",
  "  Stood on our storming-day;",
  "With neck out-thrust, you fancy how,",
  "  Legs wide, arms locked behind,",
  "As if to balance the prone brow",
  "  Oppressive with its mind.",

  "  A rider, bound on bound",
  "Full-galloping; nor bridle drew",

  "  And held himself erect",
  "By just his horse's mane, a boy:",

  "  Touched to the quick, he said:",
  "\"I'm killed, Sire!\" And his chief beside,",
  "  Smiling, the boy fell dead.",
