  "Just as the vessel entered the water the bridge and staging gave way,",
  "Immersing some three hundred people which caused great dismay",
  "Amongst the thousands of spectators that were standing there,",

  "",
  "Then the police boats instantly made for the fatal spot,",
  "And with the aid of dockyard hands several people were got,",

  "Which they will remember while life remains.",
  "",
  "Oh, Heaven! it was horrible to see the bodies laid out in rows,",
  "And as Fathers and Mothers passed along, adown their cheeks the tears flows,",
  "While their poor, sickly hearts were throbbing with fear.",
  "",
  "",
  "A great crowd had gathered to search for the missing dead,",
  "And many strong men broke down because their heart with pity bled,",

  "There's one brave man in particular I must mention,",
  "And I'm sure he's worthy of the people's attention.",
  "His name is Thomas Cooke, of No. 6 Percy Road, Canning Town,",

  "Because to me it appears quite clear,",
  "That the stronger we our houses do build,",
  "The less chance we have of being killed.",
