  "In the dark dome of heaven; some did shed",
  "A clear mild beam like Hesperus, while the sea",
  "Yet glows with fading sunlight; others dashed",

  "The chariot paused a moment;",
  "The Spirit then descended:",
  "And from the earth departing",
  "The shadows with swift wings",
  "Speeded like thought upon the light of Heaven.",
  "",
  "The Body and the Soul united then,",
  "A gentle start convulsed Ianthe's frame:",
  "Her veiny eyelids quietly unclosed;",
  "Moveless awhile the dark blue orbs remained:",
  "She looked around in wonder and beheld",
  "Henry, who kneeled in silence by her couch,",
  "Watching her sleep with looks of speechless love,",
  "And the bright beaming stars",
  "That through the casement shone.",
