  "Now, henceforth, and forever,--O latest to whom I upraise",
  "Hand and heart and voice! For Athens, leave pasture and flock!",
  "Present to help, potent to save, Pan--patron I call!",
  "Archons of Athens, topped by the tettix, see, I return!",
  "See, 'tis myself here standing alive, no spectre that speaks!",
  "Crowned with the myrtle, did you command me, Athens and you,",
  "\"Run, Pheidippides, run and race, reach Sparta for aid!",
  "Persia has come, we are here, where is She?\" Your command I obeyed,",
  "Ran and raced: like stubble, some field which a fire runs through,",
  "Was the space between city and city: two days, two nights did I burn",
  "Over the hills, under the dales, down pits and up peaks.",
  "",
  "Into their midst I broke: breath served but for \"Persia has come!",
  "Persia bids Athens proffer slaves'-tribute, water and earth;",
  "Razed to the ground is Eretria.--but Athens, shall Athens sink,",
  "Drop into dust and die--the flower of Hellas utterly die,",
  "Die with the wide world spitting at Sparta, the stupid, the stander-by?",
  "Answer me quick,--what help, what hand do you stretch o'er destruction's brink?",
  "How,--when? No care for my limbs!--there's lightning in all and some--",
  "Fresh and fit your message to bear, once lips give it birth!\"",
  "",
  "O my Athens--Sparta love thee? did Sparta respond?",
  "Every face of her leered in a furrow of envy, mistrust,",
  "Malice,--each eye of her gave me its glitter of gratified hate!",
  "Gravely they turned to take counsel, to cast for excuses. I stood",
  "Quivering,--the limbs of me fretting as fire frets, an inch from dry wood:",
  "\"Persia has come, Athens asks aid, and still they debate?",
  "Thunder, thou Zeus! Athene, are Spartans a quarry beyond",
  "Swing of thy spear? Phoibos and Artemis, clang them 'Ye must'!\"",
  "",
  "No bolt launched from Olumpos! Lo, their answer at last!",
  "\"Has Persia come,--does Athens ask aid,--may Sparta befriend?",
  "Nowise precipitate judgment--too weighty the issue at stake!",
  "Count we no time lost time which lags thro' respect to the Gods!",
  "Ponder that precept of old, 'No warfare, whatever the odds",
  "In your favour, so long as the moon, half-orbed, is unable to take",
  "Full-circle her state in the sky!' Already she rounds to it fast:",
  "Athens must wait, patient as we--who judgment suspend.\"",
  "",
  "Athens,--except for that sparkle,--thy name, I had mouldered to ash!",
  "That sent a blaze thro' my blood; off, off and away was I back,",
  "--Not one word to waste, one look to lose on the false and the vile!",
  "Yet \"O Gods of my land!\" I cried, as each hillock and plain,",
  "Wood and stream, I knew, I named, rushing past them again,",

  "Rather I hail thee, Parnes,--trust to thy wild waste tract!",
  "Treeless, herbless, lifeless mountain! What matter if slacked",
  "My speed may hardly be, for homage to crag and to cave",
  "No deity deigns to drape with verdure?--at least I can breathe,",
  "Fear in thee no fraud from the blind, no lie from the mute!\"",
  "",
  "Such my cry as, rapid, I ran over Parnes' ridge;",
  "Gully and gap I clambered and cleared till, sudden, a bar",

  "Right! for I minded the hollow to traverse, the fissure across:",
  "\"Where I could enter, there I depart by! Night in the fosse?",
  "Athens to aid? Tho' the dive were thro' Erebos, thus I obey--",
  "Out of the day dive, into the day as bravely arise! No bridge",
  "Better!\"--when--ha! what was it I came on, of wonders that are?",
  "",
  "There, in the cool of a cleft, sat he--majestical Pan!",
  "Ivy drooped wanton, kissed his head, moss cushioned his hoof;",
  "All the great God was good in the eyes grave-kindly--the curl",
  "Carved on the bearded cheek, amused at a mortal's awe",
  "As, under the human trunk, the goat-thighs grand I saw.",
  "\"Halt, Pheidippides!\"--halt I did, my brain of a whirl:",

  "\"How is it,--Athens, only in Hellas, holds me aloof?",
  "",
  "\"Athens, she only, rears me no fane, makes me no feast!",
  "Wherefore? Than I what godship to Athens more helpful of old?",
  "Ay, and still, and forever her friend! Test Pan, trust me!",
  "Go bid Athens take heart, laugh Persia to scorn, have faith",
  "In the temples and tombs! Go, say to Athens, 'The Goat-God saith:",
  "When Persia--so much as strews not the soil--Is cast in the sea,",
  "Then praise Pan who fought in the ranks with your most and least,",
  "Goat-thigh to greaved-thigh, made one cause with the free and the bold!'",
  "",
  "\"Say Pan saith: 'Let this, foreshowing the place, be the pledge!'\"",
  "(Gay, the liberal hand held out this herbage I bear",

  "\"While, as for thee...\" But enough! He was gone. If I ran hitherto--",
  "Be sure that the rest of my journey, I ran no longer, but flew.",
  "Parnes to Athens--earth no more, the air was my road;",
  "Here am I back. Praise Pan, we stand no more on the razor's edge!",
  "Pan for Athens, Pan for me! I too have a guerdon rare!",
  "",
  "Then spoke Miltiades. \"And thee, best runner of Greece,",
  "Whose limbs did duty indeed,--what gift is promised thyself?",
  "Tell it us straightway,--Athens the mother demands of her son!\"",
  "Rosily blushed the youth: he paused: but, lifting at length",
  "His eyes from the ground, it seemed as he gathered the rest of his strength",
  "Into the utterance--\"Pan spoke thus: 'For what thou hast done",
  "Count on a worthy reward! Henceforth be allowed thee release",
  "From the racer's toil, no vulgar reward in praise or in pelf!'",

  "\"I am bold to believe, Pan means reward the most to my mind!",
  "Fight I shall, with our foremost, wherever this fennel may grow,--",
  "Pound--Pan helping us--Persia to dust, and, under the deep,",

  "Marry a certain maid, I know keeps faith to the brave,--",
  "Hie to my house and home: and, when my children shall creep",
  "Close to my knees,--recount how the God was awful yet kind,",

  "Unforeseeing one! Yes, he fought on the Marathon day:",
  "So, when Persia was dust, all cried \"To Akropolis!",
  "Run, Pheidippides, one race more! the meed is thy due!",
  "'Athens is saved, thank Pan,' go shout!\" He flung down his shield,",
  "Ran like fire once more: and the space 'twixt the Fennel-field",
  "And Athens was stubble again, a field which a fire runs through,",
  "Till in he broke: \"Rejoice, we conquer!\" Like wine thro' clay,",
  "Joy in his blood bursting his heart, he died--the bliss!",

  "So is Pheidippides happy forever,--the noble strong man",
  "Who could race like a god, bear the face of a god, whom a god loved so well,",
  "He saw the land saved he had helped to save, and was suffered to tell",
  "Such tidings, yet never decline, but, gloriously as he began,",
  "So to end gloriously--once to shout, thereafter be mute:",
