  "Fortù, Fortù, my beloved one,",
  "        Sit here by my side,",
  "On my knees put up both little feet!",
  "        I was sure, if I tried,",
  "I could make you laugh spite of Scirocco.",
  "        Now, open your eyes,",
  "Let me keep you amused till he vanish",
  "        In black from the skies,",
  "With telling my memories over",
  "        As you tell your beads;",
  "All the Plain saw me gather, I garland",
  "        --The flowers or the weeds.",
  "",
  "Time for rain! for your long hot dry Autumn",
  "        Had net-worked with brown",
  "The white skin of each grape on the bunches,",
  "        Marked like a quail's crown,",
  "Those creatures you make such account of,",
  "        Whose heads--speckled white",
  "Over brown like a great spider's back,",
  "        As I told you last night--",
  "Your mother bites off for her supper.",
  "        Red-ripe as could be,",
  "Pomegranates were chapping and splitting",
  "        In halves on the tree:",
  "And betwixt the loose walls of great flintstone,",
  "        Or in the thick dust",
  "On the path, or straight out of the rockside,",
  "        Wherever could thrust",
  "Some burnt sprig of bold hardy rock-flower",
  "        Its yellow face up,",
  "For the prize were great butterflies fighting,",
  "        Some five for one cup.",
  "So, I guessed, ere I got up this morning,",
  "        What change was in store,",
  "By the quick rustle-down of the quail-nets",
  "        Which woke me before",
  "I could open my shutter, made fast",
  "        With a bough and a stone,",
  "And look thro' the twisted dead vine-twigs,",
  "        Sole lattice that's known.",
  "Quick and sharp rang the rings down the net-poles,",
  "        While, busy beneath,",
  "Your priest and his brother tugged at them,",
  "        The rain in their teeth.",
  "And out upon all the flat house-roofs",
  "        Where split figs lay drying,",
  "The girls took the frails under cover:",
  "        Nor use seemed in trying",
  "To get out the boats and go fishing,",
  "        For, under the cliff,",
  "Fierce the black water frothed o'er the blind-rock.",
  "        No seeing our skiff",
  "Arrive about noon from Amalfi,",
  "        --Our fisher arrive,",
  "And pitch down his basket before us,",
  "        All trembling alive",
  "With pink and grey jellies, your sea-fruit;",
  "        You touch the strange lumps,",
  "And mouths gape there, eyes open, all manner",
  "        Of horns and of humps,",
  "Which only the fisher looks grave at,",
  "        While round him like imps",
  "Cling screaming the children as naked",
  "        And brown as his shrimps;",
  "Himself too as bare to the middle",
  "        --You see round his neck",
  "The string and its brass coin suspended,",
  "        That saves him from wreck.",
  "But to-day not a boat reached Salerno,",
  "        So back, to a man,",
  "Came our friends, with whose help in the vineyards",
  "        Grape-harvest began.",
  "In the vat, halfway up in our houseside,",
  "        Like blood the juice spins,",
  "While your brother all bare-legged is dancing",
  "        Till breathless he grins",
  "Dead-beaten in effort on effort",
  "        To keep the grapes under,",
  "Since still when he seems all but master,",
  "        In pours the fresh plunder",
  "From girls who keep coming and going",
  "        With basket on shoulder,",
  "And eyes shut against the rain's driving;",
  "        Your girls that are older,--",
  "For under the hedges of aloe,",
  "        And where, on its bed",
  "Of the orchard's black mould, the love-apple",
  "        Lies pulpy and red,",
  "All the young ones are kneeling and filling",
  "        Their laps with the snails",
  "Tempted out by this first rainy weather,--",
  "        Your best of regales,",
  "As to-night will be proved to my sorrow,",
  "        When, supping in state,",
  "We shall feast our grape-gleaners (two dozen,",
  "        Three over one plate)",
  "With lasagne so tempting to swallow,",
  "        In slippery ropes,",
  "And gourds fried in great purple slices,",
  "        That colour of popes.",
  "Meantime, see the grape bunch they've brought you:",
  "        The rain-water slips",
  "O'er the heavy blue bloom on each globe",
  "        Which the wasp to your lips",
  "Still follows with fretful persistence:",
  "        Nay, taste, while awake,",
  "This half of a curd-white smooth cheese-ball",
  "        That peels, flake by flake,",
  "Like an onion, each smoother and whiter;",
  "        Next, sip this weak wine",
  "From the thin green glass flask, with its stopper,",
  "        A leaf of the vine;",
  "And end with the prickly-pear's red flesh",
  "        That leaves thro' its juice",
  "The stony black seeds on your pearl-teeth.",
  "        Scirocco is loose!",
  "Hark, the quick, whistling pelt of the olives",
  "        Which, thick in one's track,",
  "Tempt the stranger to pick up and bite them,",
  "        Tho' not yet half black!",
  "How the old twisted olive trunks shudder,",
  "        The medlars let fall",
  "Their hard fruit, and the brittle great fig-trees",
  "        Snap off, figs and all,",
  "For here comes the whole of the tempest!",
  "        No refuge, but creep",
  "Back again to my side and my shoulder,",
  "        And listen or sleep.",
  "O how will your country show next week,",
  "        When all the vine-boughs",
  "Have been stripped of their foliage to pasture",
  "        The mules and the cows?",
  "Last eve, I rode over the mountains,",
  "        Your brother, my guide,",
  "Soon left me, to feast on the myrtles",
  "        That offered, each side,",
  "Their fruit-balls, black, glossy and luscious,--",
  "        Or strip from the sorbs",
  "A treasure, or, rosy and wondrous,",
  "        Those hairy gold orbs!",
  "But my mule picked his sure sober path out,",
  "        Just stopping to neigh",
  "When he recognized down in the valley",
  "        His mates on their way",
  "With the faggots and barrels of water;",
  "        And soon we emerged",
  "From the plain, where the woods could scarce follow;",
  "        And still as we urged",
  "Our way, the woods wondered, and left us,",
  "        As up still we trudged",
  "Though the wild path grew wilder each instant,",
  "        And place was e'en grudged",
  "'Mid the rock-chasms and piles of loose stones",
  "        Like the loose broken teeth",
  "Of some monster which climbed there to die",
  "        From the ocean beneath--",
  "Place was grudged to the silver-grey fume-weed",
  "        That clung to the path,",
  "And dark rosemary ever a-dying",
  "        That, 'spite the wind's wrath,",
  "So loves the salt rock's face to seaward,",
  "        And lentisks as staunch",
  "To the stone where they root and bear berries,",
  "        And... what shows a branch",
  "Coral-coloured, transparent, with circlets",
  "        Of pale seagreen leaves;",
  "Over all trod my mule with the caution",
  "        Of gleaners o'er sheaves,",
  "Still, foot after foot like a lad",
  "        Till, round after round,",
  "He climbed to the top of Calvano,",
  "        And God's own profound",
  "Was above me, and round me the mountains,",
  "        And under, the sea,",
  "And within me my heart to bear witness",
  "        What was and shall be.",
  "",
  "Oh, heaven and the terrible crystal!",
  "        No rampart excludes",
  "Your eye from the life to be lived",
  "        In the blue solitudes.",
  "Oh, those mountains, their infinite movement!",
  "        Still moving with you;",
  "For, ever some new head and breast of them",
  "        Thrusts into view",
  "To observe the intruder; you see it",
  "        If quickly you turn",
  "And, before they escape you surprise them.",
  "        They grudge you should learn",
  "How the soft plains they look on, lean over",
  "        And love (they pretend)",
  "--Cower beneath them, the flat sea-pine crouches,",
  "        The wild fruit-trees bend,",
  "E'en the myrtle-leaves curl, shrink and shut:",
  "        All is silent and grave:",
  "'Tis a sensual and timorous beauty,",
  "        How fair! but a slave.",
  "So, I turned to the sea; and there slumbered",
  "        As greenly as ever",
  "Those isles of the siren, your Galli;",
  "        No ages can sever",
  "The Three, nor enable their sister",
  "        To join them,--halfway",
  "On the voyage, she looked at Ulysses--",
  "        No farther to-day,",
  "Tho' the small one, just launched in the wave,",
  "        Watches breast-high and steady",
  "From under the rock, her bold sister",
  "        Swum halfway already.",
  "Fortù, shall we sail there together",
  "        And see from the sides",
  "Quite new rocks show their faces, new haunts",
  "        Where the siren abides?",
  "Shall we sail round and round them, close over",
  "        The rocks, tho' unseen,",
  "That ruffle the grey glassy water",
  "        To glorious green?",
  "Then scramble from splinter to splinter,",
  "        Reach land and explore,",
  "On the largest, the strange square black turret",
  "        With never a door,",
  "Just a loop to admit the quick lizards;",
  "        Then, stand there and hear",
  "The birds' quiet singing, that tells us",
  "        What life is, so clear?",
  "--The secret they sang to Ulysses",
  "        When, ages ago,",
  "He heard and he knew this life's secret",
  "        I hear and I know.",
  "",
  "Ah, see! The sun breaks o'er Calvano;",
  "        He strikes the great gloom",
  "And flutters it o'er the mount's summit",
  "        In airy gold fume.",
  "All is over.  Look out, see the gipsy,",
  "        Our tinker and smith,",
  "Has arrived, set up bellows and forge,",
  "        And down-squatted forthwith",
  "To his hammering, under the wall there;",
  "        One eye keeps aloof",
  "The urchins that itch to be putting",
  "        His jews'-harps to proof,",
  "While the other, thro' locks of curled wire,",
  "        Is watching how sleek",
  "Shines the hog, come to share in the windfall",
  "        --Chew, abbot's own cheek!",
  "All is over.  Wake up and come out now,",
  "        And down let us go,",
  "And see the fine things got in order",
  "        At church for the show",
  "Of the Sacrament, set forth this evening.",
  "        To-morrow's the Feast",
  "Of the Rosary's Virgin, by no means",
  "        Of Virgins the least,",
  "As you'll hear in the off-hand discourse",
  "        Which (all nature, no art)",
  "The Dominican brother, these three weeks,",
  "        Was getting by heart.",
  "Not a pillar nor post but is dizened",
  "        With red and blue papers;",
  "All the roof waves with ribbons, each altar",
  "        A-blaze with long tapers;",
  "But the great masterpiece is the scaffold",
  "        Rigged glorious to hold",
  "All the fiddlers and fifers and drummers",
  "        And trumpeters bold,",
  "Not afraid of Bellini nor Auber,",
  "        Who, when the priest's hoarse,",
  "Will strike us up something that's brisk",
  "        For the feast's second course.",
  "And then will the flaxen-wigged Image",
  "        Be carried in pomp",
  "Thro' the plain, while in gallant procession",
  "        The priests mean to stomp.",
  "All round the glad church lie old bottles",
  "        With gunpowder stopped,",
  "Which will be, when the Image re-enters,",
  "        Religiously popped;",
  "And at night from the crest of Calvano",
  "        Great bonfires will hang,",
  "On the plain will the trumpets join chorus,",
  "        And more poppers bang.",
  "At all events, come-to the garden",
  "        As far as the wall;",
  "See me tap with a hoe on the plaster",
  "        Till out there shall fall",
  "A scorpion with wide angry nippers!",
  "",
  "        --\"Such trifles!\" you say?",
  "Fortù, in my England at home,",
  "        Men meet gravely to-day",
  "And debate, if abolishing Corn-laws",
  "        Be righteous and wise",
  "--If 'twere proper, Scirocco should vanish",
  "        In black from the skies!",
