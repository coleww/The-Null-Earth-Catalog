  "The unhappy exile, whom his fates confine",
  "To the bleak coast of some unfriendly isle,",
  "Cold, barren, desart, where no harvests smile,",
  "But thirst and hunger on the rocks repine;",
  "When, from some promontory's fearful brow,",
  "Sun after sun he hopeless sees decline",
  "In the broad shipless sea—perhaps may know",
  "Such heartless pain, such blank despair as mine;",
  "And, if a flattering cloud appears to show",
  "The fancied semblance of a distant sail,",
  "Then melts away—anew his spirits fail,",
  "While the lost hope but aggravates his woe!",
  "Ah! so for me delusive Fancy toils,",
  "Then, from contrasted truth—my feeble soul recoils.",
