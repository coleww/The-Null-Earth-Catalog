  "Pellam the King, who held and lost with Lot",
  "In that first war, and had his realm restored",
  "But rendered tributary, failed of late",
  "To send his tribute; wherefore Arthur called",
  "His treasurer, one of many years, and spake,",
  "'Go thou with him and him and bring it to us,",
  "Lest we should set one truer on his throne.",
  "Man's word is God in man.'",
  "His Baron said",
  "'We go but harken: there be two strange knights",
  "",
  "Who sit near Camelot at a fountain-side,",
  "A mile beneath the forest, challenging",
  "And overthrowing every knight who comes.",
  "Wilt thou I undertake them as we pass,",
  "And send them to thee?'",
  "Arthur laughed upon him.",
  "'Old friend, too old to be so young, depart,",
  "Delay not thou for aught, but let them sit,",
  "Until they find a lustier than themselves.'",
  "",
  "So these departed. Early, one fair dawn,",
  "The light-winged spirit of his youth returned",
  "On Arthur's heart; he armed himself and went,",
  "So coming to the fountain-side beheld",
  "Balin and Balan sitting statuelike,",
  "Brethren, to right and left the spring, that down,",
  "From underneath a plume of lady-fern,",
  "Sang, and the sand danced at the bottom of it.",
  "And on the right of Balin Balin's horse",
  "Was fast beside an alder, on the left",
  "Of Balan Balan's near a poplartree.",
  "'Fair Sirs,' said Arthur, 'wherefore sit ye here?'",
  "Balin and Balan answered 'For the sake",
  "Of glory; we be mightier men than all",
  "In Arthur's court; that also have we proved;",
  "For whatsoever knight against us came",
  "Or I or he have easily overthrown.'",
  "'I too,' said Arthur, 'am of Arthur's hall,",
  "But rather proven in his Paynim wars",
  "Than famous jousts; but see, or proven or not,",
  "Whether me likewise ye can overthrow.'",
  "And Arthur lightly smote the brethren down,",
  "And lightly so returned, and no man knew.",
  "",
  "Then Balin rose, and Balan, and beside",
  "The carolling water set themselves again,",
  "And spake no word until the shadow turned;",
  "When from the fringe of coppice round them burst",
  "A spangled pursuivant, and crying 'Sirs,",
  "Rise, follow! ye be sent for by the King,'",
  "They followed; whom when Arthur seeing asked",
  "'Tell me your names; why sat ye by the well?'",
  "Balin the stillness of a minute broke",
  "Saying 'An unmelodious name to thee,",
  "Balin, \"the Savage\"--that addition thine--",
  "My brother and my better, this man here,",
  "Balan. I smote upon the naked skull",
  "A thrall of thine in open hall, my hand",
  "Was gauntleted, half slew him; for I heard",
  "He had spoken evil of me; thy just wrath",
  "Sent me a three-years' exile from thine eyes.",
  "I have not lived my life delightsomely:",
  "For I that did that violence to thy thrall,",
  "Had often wrought some fury on myself,",
  "Saving for Balan: those three kingless years",
  "Have past--were wormwood-bitter to me. King,",
  "Methought that if we sat beside the well,",
  "And hurled to ground what knight soever spurred",
  "Against us, thou would'st take me gladlier back,",
  "And make, as ten-times worthier to be thine",
  "Than twenty Balins, Balan knight. I have said.",
  "Not so--not all. A man of thine today",
  "Abashed us both, and brake my boast. Thy will?'",
  "Said Arthur 'Thou hast ever spoken truth;",
  "Thy too fierce manhood would not let thee lie.",
  "Rise, my true knight. As children learn, be thou",
  "Wiser for falling! walk with me, and move",
  "To music with thine Order and the King.",
  "Thy chair, a grief to all the brethren, stands",
  "Vacant, but thou retake it, mine again!'",
  "",
  "Thereafter, when Sir Balin entered hall,",
  "The Lost one Found was greeted as in Heaven",
  "With joy that blazed itself in woodland wealth",
  "Of leaf, and gayest garlandage of flowers,",
  "Along the walls and down the board; they sat,",
  "And cup clashed cup; they drank and some one sang,",
  "Sweet-voiced, a song of welcome, whereupon",
  "Their common shout in chorus, mounting, made",
  "Those banners of twelve battles overhead",
  "Stir, as they stirred of old, when Arthur's host",
  "Proclaimed him Victor, and the day was won.",
  "",
  "Then Balan added to their Order lived",
  "A wealthier life than heretofore with these",
  "And Balin, till their embassage returned.",
  "",
  "'Sir King' they brought report 'we hardly found,",
  "So bushed about it is with gloom, the hall",
  "Of him to whom ye sent us, Pellam, once",
  "A Christless foe of thine as ever dashed",
  "Horse against horse; but seeing that thy realm",
  "Hath prospered in the name of Christ, the King",
  "Took, as in rival heat, to holy things;",
  "And finds himself descended from the Saint",
  "Arimathan Joseph; him who first",
  "Brought the great faith to Britain over seas;",
  "He boasts his life as purer than thine own;",
  "Eats scarce enow to keep his pulse abeat;",
  "Hath pushed aside his faithful wife, nor lets",
  "Or dame or damsel enter at his gates",
  "Lest he should be polluted. This gray King",
  "Showed us a shrine wherein were wonders--yea--",
  "Rich arks with priceless bones of martyrdom,",
  "Thorns of the crown and shivers of the cross,",
  "And therewithal (for thus he told us) brought",
  "By holy Joseph thither, that same spear",
  "Wherewith the Roman pierced the side of Christ.",
  "He much amazed us; after, when we sought",
  "The tribute, answered \"I have quite foregone",
  "All matters of this world: Garlon, mine heir,",
  "Of him demand it,\" which this Garlon gave",
  "With much ado, railing at thine and thee.",
  "",
  "'But when we left, in those deep woods we found",
  "A knight of thine spear-stricken from behind,",
  "Dead, whom we buried; more than one of us",
  "Cried out on Garlon, but a woodman there",
  "Reported of some demon in the woods",
  "Was once a man, who driven by evil tongues",
  "From all his fellows, lived alone, and came",
  "To learn black magic, and to hate his kind",
  "With such a hate, that when he died, his soul",
  "Became a Fiend, which, as the man in life",
  "Was wounded by blind tongues he saw not whence,",
  "Strikes from behind. This woodman showed the cave",
  "From which he sallies, and wherein he dwelt.",

  "",
  "Then Arthur, 'Let who goes before me, see",
  "He do not fall behind me: foully slain",
  "And villainously! who will hunt for me",
  "This demon of the woods?' Said Balan, 'I'!",
  "So claimed the quest and rode away, but first,",
  "Embracing Balin, 'Good my brother, hear!",
  "Let not thy moods prevail, when I am gone",
  "Who used to lay them! hold them outer fiends,",
  "Who leap at thee to tear thee; shake them aside,",
  "Dreams ruling when wit sleeps! yea, but to dream",
  "That any of these would wrong thee, wrongs thyself.",
  "Witness their flowery welcome. Bound are they",
  "To speak no evil. Truly save for fears,",
  "My fears for thee, so rich a fellowship",
  "Would make me wholly blest: thou one of them,",
  "Be one indeed: consider them, and all",
  "Their bearing in their common bond of love,",
  "No more of hatred than in Heaven itself,",
  "No more of jealousy than in Paradise.'",
  "",
  "So Balan warned, and went; Balin remained:",
  "Who--for but three brief moons had glanced away",
  "From being knighted till he smote the thrall,",
  "And faded from the presence into years",
  "Of exile--now would strictlier set himself",
  "To learn what Arthur meant by courtesy,",
  "Manhood, and knighthood; wherefore hovered round",
  "Lancelot, but when he marked his high sweet smile",
  "In passing, and a transitory word",
  "Make knight or churl or child or damsel seem",
  "From being smiled at happier in themselves--",
  "Sighed, as a boy lame-born beneath a height,",
  "That glooms his valley, sighs to see the peak",
  "Sun-flushed, or touch at night the northern star;",
  "For one from out his village lately climed",
  "And brought report of azure lands and fair,",
  "Far seen to left and right; and he himself",
  "Hath hardly scaled with help a hundred feet",
  "Up from the base: so Balin marvelling oft",
  "How far beyond him Lancelot seemed to move,",
  "Groaned, and at times would mutter, 'These be gifts,",
  "Born with the blood, not learnable, divine,",
  "Beyond MY reach. Well had I foughten--well--",
  "In those fierce wars, struck hard--and had I crowned",
  "With my slain self the heaps of whom I slew--",
  "So--better!--But this worship of the Queen,",
  "That honour too wherein she holds him--this,",
  "This was the sunshine that hath given the man",
  "A growth, a name that branches o'er the rest,",
  "And strength against all odds, and what the King",
  "So prizes--overprizes--gentleness.",
  "Her likewise would I worship an I might.",
  "I never can be close with her, as he",

  "To let me bear some token of his Queen",
  "Whereon to gaze, remembering her--forget",
  "My heats and violences? live afresh?",
  "What, if the Queen disdained to grant it! nay",
  "Being so stately-gentle, would she make",
  "My darkness blackness? and with how sweet grace",
  "She greeted my return! Bold will I be--",
  "Some goodly cognizance of Guinevere,",
  "In lieu of this rough beast upon my shield,",
  "Langued gules, and toothed with grinning savagery.'",
  "",
  "And Arthur, when Sir Balin sought him, said",
  "'What wilt thou bear?' Balin was bold, and asked",
  "To bear her own crown-royal upon shield,",
  "Whereat she smiled and turned her to the King,",
  "Who answered 'Thou shalt put the crown to use.",
  "The crown is but the shadow of the King,",
  "And this a shadow's shadow, let him have it,",
  "So this will help him of his violences!'",
  "'No shadow' said Sir Balin 'O my Queen,",
  "But light to me! no shadow, O my King,",
  "But golden earnest of a gentler life!'",
  "",
  "So Balin bare the crown, and all the knights",
  "Approved him, and the Queen, and all the world",

  "In music with his Order, and the King.",
  "",
  "The nightingale, full-toned in middle May,",
  "Hath ever and anon a note so thin",
  "It seems another voice in other groves;",
  "Thus, after some quick burst of sudden wrath,",
  "The music in him seemed to change, and grow",
  "Faint and far-off.",
  "And once he saw the thrall",
  "His passion half had gauntleted to death,",
  "That causer of his banishment and shame,",
  "Smile at him, as he deemed, presumptuously:",
  "His arm half rose to strike again, but fell:",

  "Weighted it down, but in himself he moaned:",
  "",
  "'Too high this mount of Camelot for me:",
  "These high-set courtesies are not for me.",
  "Shall I not rather prove the worse for these?",
  "Fierier and stormier from restraining, break",
  "Into some madness even before the Queen?'",
  "",
  "Thus, as a hearth lit in a mountain home,",
  "And glancing on the window, when the gloom",
  "Of twilight deepens round it, seems a flame",
  "That rages in the woodland far below,",
  "So when his moods were darkened, court and King",
  "And all the kindly warmth of Arthur's hall",
  "Shadowed an angry distance: yet he strove",
  "To learn the graces of their Table, fought",
  "Hard with himself, and seemed at length in peace.",
  "",
  "Then chanced, one morning, that Sir Balin sat",
  "Close-bowered in that garden nigh the hall.",
  "A walk of roses ran from door to door;",
  "A walk of lilies crost it to the bower:",
  "And down that range of roses the great Queen",
  "Came with slow steps, the morning on her face;",
  "And all in shadow from the counter door",
  "Sir Lancelot as to meet her, then at once,",
  "As if he saw not, glanced aside, and paced",
  "The long white walk of lilies toward the bower.",
  "Followed the Queen; Sir Balin heard her 'Prince,",
  "Art thou so little loyal to thy Queen,",
  "As pass without good morrow to thy Queen?'",
  "To whom Sir Lancelot with his eyes on earth,",
  "'Fain would I still be loyal to the Queen.'",
  "'Yea so' she said 'but so to pass me by--",

  "",
  "Then Lancelot with his hand among the flowers",
  "'Yea--for a dream. Last night methought I saw",
  "That maiden Saint who stands with lily in hand",
  "In yonder shrine. All round her prest the dark,",
  "And all the light upon her silver face",
  "Flowed from the spiritual lily that she held.",
  "Lo! these her emblems drew mine eyes--away:",
  "For see, how perfect-pure! As light a flush",
  "As hardly tints the blossom of the quince",
  "Would mar their charm of stainless maidenhood.'",
  "",
  "'Sweeter to me' she said 'this garden rose",
  "Deep-hued and many-folded! sweeter still",
  "The wild-wood hyacinth and the bloom of May.",
  "Prince, we have ridden before among the flowers",
  "In those fair days--not all as cool as these,",
  "Though season-earlier. Art thou sad? or sick?",
  "Our noble King will send thee his own leech--",
  "Sick? or for any matter angered at me?'",
  "",
  "Then Lancelot lifted his large eyes; they dwelt",
  "Deep-tranced on hers, and could not fall: her hue",
  "Changed at his gaze: so turning side by side",
  "They past, and Balin started from his bower.",
  "",
  "'Queen? subject? but I see not what I see.",
  "Damsel and lover? hear not what I hear.",
  "My father hath begotten me in his wrath.",
  "I suffer from the things before me, know,",
  "Learn nothing; am not worthy to be knight;",
  "A churl, a clown!' and in him gloom on gloom",
  "Deepened: he sharply caught his lance and shield,",
  "Nor stayed to crave permission of the King,",
  "But, mad for strange adventure, dashed away.",
  "",
  "He took the selfsame track as Balan, saw",
  "The fountain where they sat together, sighed",
  "'Was I not better there with him?' and rode",
  "The skyless woods, but under open blue",
  "Came on the hoarhead woodman at a bough",
  "Wearily hewing. 'Churl, thine axe!' he cried,",
  "Descended, and disjointed it at a blow:",
  "To whom the woodman uttered wonderingly",
  "'Lord, thou couldst lay the Devil of these woods",
  "If arm of flesh could lay him.' Balin cried",
  "'Him, or the viler devil who plays his part,",
  "To lay that devil would lay the Devil in me.'",
  "'Nay' said the churl, 'our devil is a truth,",
  "I saw the flash of him but yestereven.",
  "And some DO say that our Sir Garlon too",
  "Hath learned black magic, and to ride unseen.",
  "Look to the cave.' But Balin answered him",
  "'Old fabler, these be fancies of the churl,",
  "Look to thy woodcraft,' and so leaving him,",
  "Now with slack rein and careless of himself,",
  "Now with dug spur and raving at himself,",
  "Now with droopt brow down the long glades he rode;",
  "So marked not on his right a cavern-chasm",
  "Yawn over darkness, where, nor far within,",
  "The whole day died, but, dying, gleamed on rocks",
  "Roof-pendent, sharp; and others from the floor,",
  "Tusklike, arising, made that mouth of night",
  "Whereout the Demon issued up from Hell.",
  "He marked not this, but blind and deaf to all",
  "Save that chained rage, which ever yelpt within,",
  "Past eastward from the falling sun. At once",
  "He felt the hollow-beaten mosses thud",
  "And tremble, and then the shadow of a spear,",
  "Shot from behind him, ran along the ground.",
  "Sideways he started from the path, and saw,",
  "With pointed lance as if to pierce, a shape,",
  "A light of armour by him flash, and pass",
  "And vanish in the woods; and followed this,",
  "But all so blind in rage that unawares",
  "He burst his lance against a forest bough,",
  "Dishorsed himself, and rose again, and fled",
  "Far, till the castle of a King, the hall",
  "Of Pellam, lichen-bearded, grayly draped",
  "With streaming grass, appeared, low-built but strong;",
  "The ruinous donjon as a knoll of moss,",
  "The battlement overtopt with ivytods,",
  "A home of bats, in every tower an owl.",
  "Then spake the men of Pellam crying 'Lord,",
  "Why wear ye this crown-royal upon shield?'",
  "Said Balin 'For the fairest and the best",
  "Of ladies living gave me this to bear.'",
  "So stalled his horse, and strode across the court,",
  "But found the greetings both of knight and King",
  "Faint in the low dark hall of banquet: leaves",
  "Laid their green faces flat against the panes,",
  "Sprays grated, and the cankered boughs without",
  "Whined in the wood; for all was hushed within,",
  "Till when at feast Sir Garlon likewise asked",
  "'Why wear ye that crown-royal?' Balin said",
  "'The Queen we worship, Lancelot, I, and all,",
  "As fairest, best and purest, granted me",
  "To bear it!' Such a sound (for Arthur's knights",
  "Were hated strangers in the hall) as makes",
  "The white swan-mother, sitting, when she hears",
  "A strange knee rustle through her secret reeds,",
  "Made Garlon, hissing; then he sourly smiled.",
  "'Fairest I grant her: I have seen; but best,",
  "Best, purest? THOU from Arthur's hall, and yet",
  "So simple! hast thou eyes, or if, are these",
  "So far besotted that they fail to see",
  "This fair wife-worship cloaks a secret shame?",
  "Truly, ye men of Arthur be but babes.'",
  "",
  "A goblet on the board by Balin, bossed",
  "With holy Joseph's legend, on his right",
  "Stood, all of massiest bronze: one side had sea",
  "And ship and sail and angels blowing on it:",
  "And one was rough with wattling, and the walls",
  "Of that low church he built at Glastonbury.",
  "This Balin graspt, but while in act to hurl,",
  "Through memory of that token on the shield",
  "Relaxed his hold: 'I will be gentle' he thought",
  "'And passing gentle' caught his hand away,",
  "Then fiercely to Sir Garlon 'Eyes have I",
  "That saw today the shadow of a spear,",
  "Shot from behind me, run along the ground;",
  "Eyes too that long have watched how Lancelot draws",
  "From homage to the best and purest, might,",
  "Name, manhood, and a grace, but scantly thine,",
  "Who, sitting in thine own hall, canst endure",
  "To mouth so huge a foulness--to thy guest,",
  "Me, me of Arthur's Table. Felon talk!",
  "Let be! no more!'",
  "But not the less by night",
  "The scorn of Garlon, poisoning all his rest,",
  "Stung him in dreams. At length, and dim through leaves",
  "Blinkt the white morn, sprays grated, and old boughs",
  "Whined in the wood. He rose, descended, met",
  "The scorner in the castle court, and fain,",
  "For hate and loathing, would have past him by;",
  "But when Sir Garlon uttered mocking-wise;",
  "'What, wear ye still that same crown-scandalous?'",
  "His countenance blackened, and his forehead veins",
  "Bloated, and branched; and tearing out of sheath",
  "The brand, Sir Balin with a fiery 'Ha!",
  "So thou be shadow, here I make thee ghost,'",
  "Hard upon helm smote him, and the blade flew",
  "Splintering in six, and clinkt upon the stones.",
  "Then Garlon, reeling slowly backward, fell,",
  "And Balin by the banneret of his helm",
  "Dragged him, and struck, but from the castle a cry",
  "Sounded across the court, and--men-at-arms,",
  "A score with pointed lances, making at him--",
  "He dashed the pummel at the foremost face,",
  "Beneath a low door dipt, and made his feet",
  "Wings through a glimmering gallery, till he marked",
  "The portal of King Pellam's chapel wide",
  "And inward to the wall; he stept behind;",
  "Thence in a moment heard them pass like wolves",
  "Howling; but while he stared about the shrine,",
  "In which he scarce could spy the Christ for Saints,",
  "Beheld before a golden altar lie",
  "The longest lance his eyes had ever seen,",
  "Point-painted red; and seizing thereupon",
  "Pushed through an open casement down, leaned on it,",
  "Leapt in a semicircle, and lit on earth;",
  "Then hand at ear, and harkening from what side",
  "The blindfold rummage buried in the walls",
  "Might echo, ran the counter path, and found",
  "His charger, mounted on him and away.",
  "An arrow whizzed to the right, one to the left,",
  "One overhead; and Pellam's feeble cry",
  "'Stay, stay him! he defileth heavenly things",
  "With earthly uses'--made him quickly dive",
  "Beneath the boughs, and race through many a mile",
  "Of dense and open, till his goodly horse,",
  "Arising wearily at a fallen oak,",
  "Stumbled headlong, and cast him face to ground.",
  "",
  "Half-wroth he had not ended, but all glad,",
  "Knightlike, to find his charger yet unlamed,",
  "Sir Balin drew the shield from off his neck,",
  "Stared at the priceless cognizance, and thought",
  "'I have shamed thee so that now thou shamest me,",
  "Thee will I bear no more,' high on a branch",
  "Hung it, and turned aside into the woods,",
  "And there in gloom cast himself all along,",
  "Moaning 'My violences, my violences!'",
  "",
  "But now the wholesome music of the wood",
  "Was dumbed by one from out the hall of Mark,",
  "A damsel-errant, warbling, as she rode",
  "The woodland alleys, Vivien, with her Squire.",
  "",
  "'The fire of Heaven has killed the barren cold,",
  "And kindled all the plain and all the wold.",
  "The new leaf ever pushes off the old.",
  "The fire of Heaven is not the flame of Hell.",
  "",
  "'Old priest, who mumble worship in your quire--",

  "",
  "Then turning to her Squire 'This fire of Heaven,",
  "This old sun-worship, boy, will rise again,",
  "And beat the cross to earth, and break the King",
  "And all his Table.'",
  "Then they reached a glade,",
  "Where under one long lane of cloudless air",
  "Before another wood, the royal crown",
  "Sparkled, and swaying upon a restless elm",
  "Drew the vague glance of Vivien, and her Squire;",
  "Amazed were these; 'Lo there' she cried--'a crown--",
  "Borne by some high lord-prince of Arthur's hall,",
  "And there a horse! the rider? where is he?",
  "See, yonder lies one dead within the wood.",
  "Not dead; he stirs!--but sleeping. I will speak.",
  "Hail, royal knight, we break on thy sweet rest,",
  "Not, doubtless, all unearned by noble deeds.",
  "But bounden art thou, if from Arthur's hall,",
  "To help the weak. Behold, I fly from shame,",
  "A lustful King, who sought to win my love",
  "Through evil ways: the knight, with whom I rode,",
  "Hath suffered misadventure, and my squire",
  "Hath in him small defence; but thou, Sir Prince,",
  "Wilt surely guide me to the warrior King,",

  "A year ago--nay, then I love thee not--",
  "Ay, thou rememberest well--one summer dawn--",
  "By the great tower--Caerleon upon Usk--",

  "Breathed in a dismal whisper 'It is truth.'",
  "",
  "Sunnily she smiled 'And even in this lone wood,",
  "Sweet lord, ye do right well to whisper this.",
  "Fools prate, and perish traitors. Woods have tongues,",
  "As walls have ears: but thou shalt go with me,",
  "And we will speak at first exceeding low.",
  "Meet is it the good King be not deceived.",
  "See now, I set thee high on vantage ground,",
  "From whence to watch the time, and eagle-like",

  "That weird yell,",
  "Unearthlier than all shriek of bird or beast,",
  "Thrilled through the woods; and Balan lurking there",
  "(His quest was unaccomplished) heard and thought",
  "'The scream of that Wood-devil I came to quell!'",
  "Then nearing 'Lo! he hath slain some brother-knight,",

  "His loathing of our Order and the Queen.",
  "My quest, meseems, is here. Or devil or man",
  "Guard thou thine head.' Sir Balin spake not word,",
  "But snatched a sudden buckler from the Squire,",
  "And vaulted on his horse, and so they crashed",
  "In onset, and King Pellam's holy spear,",
  "Reputed to be red with sinless blood,",
  "Redded at once with sinful, for the point",
  "Across the maiden shield of Balan pricked",
  "The hauberk to the flesh; and Balin's horse",
  "Was wearied to the death, and, when they clashed,",
  "Rolling back upon Balin, crushed the man",
  "Inward, and either fell, and swooned away.",

  "Then to her Squire muttered the damsel 'Fools!",
  "This fellow hath wrought some foulness with his Queen:",
  "Else never had he borne her crown, nor raved",
  "And thus foamed over at a rival name:",
  "But thou, Sir Chick, that scarce hast broken shell,",
  "Art yet half-yolk, not even come to down--",
  "Who never sawest Caerleon upon Usk--",
  "And yet hast often pleaded for my love--",
  "See what I see, be thou where I have been,",

  "I fain would know what manner of men they be.'",
  "And when the Squire had loosed them, 'Goodly!--look!",
  "They might have cropt the myriad flower of May,",
  "And butt each other here, like brainless bulls,",
  "Dead for one heifer!",

  "'I hold them happy, so they died for love:",

  "Crawled slowly with low moans to where he lay,",
  "And on his dying brother cast himself",
  "Dying; and HE lifted faint eyes; he felt",
  "One near him; all at once they found the world,",
  "Staring wild-wide; then with a childlike wail",
  "And drawing down the dim disastrous brow",
  "That o'er him hung, he kissed it, moaned and spake;",

  "'O Balin, Balin, I that fain had died",
