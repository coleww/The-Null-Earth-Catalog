  "This is the forest primeval. The murmuring pines and the hemlocks,",
  "Bearded with moss, and in garments green, indistinct in the twilight,",
  "Stand like Druids of eld, with voices sad and prophetic,",
  "Stand like harpers hoar, with beards that rest on their bosoms.",
  "Loud from its rocky caverns, the deep-voiced neighboring ocean",
  "Speaks, and in accents disconsolate answers the wail of the forest.",
  "",
  "This is the forest primeval; but where are the hearts that beneath it",
  "Leaped like the roe, when he hears in the woodland the voice of the huntsman",
  "Where is the thatch-roofed village, the home of Acadian farmers,--",
  "Men whose lives glided on like rivers that water the woodlands,",
  "Darkened by shadows of earth, but reflecting an image of heaven?",

  "In the Acadian land, on the shores of the Basin of Minas,",
  "Distant, secluded, still, the little village of Grand-Pre",
  "Lay in the fruitful valley. Vast meadows stretched to the eastward,",
  "Giving the village its name, and pasture to flocks without number.",
  "Dikes, that the hands of the farmers had raised with labor incessant,",
  "Shut out the turbulent tides; but at stated seasons the flood-gates",
  "Opened, and welcomed the sea to wander at will o'er the meadows.",
  "West and south there were fields of flax, and orchards and cornfields",
  "Spreading afar and unfenced o'er the plain; and away to the northward",
  "Blomidon rose, and the forests old, and aloft on the mountains",
  "Sea-fogs pitched their tents, and mists from the mighty Atlantic",
  "Looked on the happy valley, but ne'er from their station descended",
  "There, in the midst of its farms, reposed the Acadian village.",
  "Strongly built were the houses, with frames of oak and of hemlock,",
  "Such as the peasants of Normandy built in the reign of the Henries.",
  "Thatched were the roofs, with dormer-windows; and gables projecting",
  "Over the basement below protected and shaded the doorway.",
  "There in the tranquil evenings of summer, when brightly the sunset",
  "Lighted the village street and gilded the vanes on the chimneys,",
  "Matrons and maidens sat in snow-white caps and in kirtles",
  "Scarlet and blue and green, with distaffs spinning the golden",
  "Flax for the gossiping looms, whose noisy shuttles within doors",
  "Mingled their sound with the whir of the wheels and the songs of the maidens,",
  "Solemnly down the street came the parish priest, and the children",
  "Paused in their play to kiss the hand he extended to bless them.",
  "Reverend walked he among them; and up rose matrons and maidens,",
  "Hailing his slow approach with words of affectionate welcome.",
  "Then came the laborers home from the field, and serenely the sun sank",
  "Down to his rest, and twilight prevailed. Anon from the belfry",
  "Softly the Angelus sounded, and over the roofs of the village",
  "Columns of pale blue smoke, like clouds of incense ascending,",
  "Rose from a hundred hearths, the homes of peace and contentment.",
  "Thus dwelt together in love these simple Acadian farmers,--",
  "Dwelt in the love of God and of man. Alike were they free from",
  "Fear, that reigns with the tyrant, and envy, the vice of republics.",
  "Neither locks had they to their doors, nor bars to their windows;",
  "But their dwellings were open as day and the hearts of their owners;",
  "There the richest was poor, and the poorest lived in abundance.",
  "",
  "Somewhat apart from the village, and nearer the Basin of Minas,",
  "Benedict Bellefontaine, the wealthiest farmer of Grand-Pre,",
  "Dwelt on his goodly acres: and with him, directing his household,",
  "Gentle Evangeline lived, his child, and the pride of the village.",
  "Stalworth and stately in form was the man of seventy winters;",
  "Hearty and hale was he, an oak that is covered with snow-flakes;",
  "White as the snow were his locks, and his cheeks as brown as the oak-leaves.",
  "Fair was she to behold, that maiden of seventeen summers.",
  "Black were her eyes as the berry that grows on the thorn by the wayside,",
  "Black, yet how softly they gleamed beneath the brown shade of her tresses!",
  "Sweet was her breath as the breath of kine that feed in the meadows.",
  "When in the harvest heat she bore to the reapers at noontide",
  "Flagons of home-brewed ale, ah! fair in sooth was the maiden,",
  "Fairer was she when, on Sunday morn, while the bell from its turret",
  "Sprinkled with holy sounds the air, as the priest with his hyssop",
  "Sprinkles the congregation, and scatters blessings upon them,",
  "Down the long street she passed, with her chaplet of beads and her missal,",
  "Wearing her Norman cap and her kirtle of blue, and the ear-rings,",
  "Brought in the olden time from France, and since, as an heirloom,",
  "Handed down from mother to child, through long generations.",
  "But a celestial brightness--a more ethereal beauty--",
  "Shone on her face and encircled her form, when, after confession,",
  "Homeward serenely she walked with God's benediction upon her.",
  "When she had passed, it seemed like the ceasing of exquisite music.",
  "",
  "Firmly builded with rafters of oak, the house of the farmer",
  "Stood on the side of a hill commanding the sea; and a shady",
  "Sycamore grew by the door, with a woodbine wreathing around it.",
  "Rudely carved was the porch, with seats beneath; and a footpath",
  "Led through an orchard wide, and disappeared in the meadow.",
  "Under the sycamore-tree were hives overhung by a penthouse,",
  "Such as the traveller sees in regions remote by the roadside,",
  "Built o'er a box for the poor, or the blessed image of Mary.",
  "Farther down, on the slope of the hill, was the well with its moss-grown",
  "Bucket, fastened with iron, and near it a trough for the horses.",
  "Shielding the house from storms, on the north, were the barns and the farm-yard,",
  "There stood the broad-wheeled wains and the antique ploughs and the harrows;",
  "There were the folds for the sheep; and there, in his feathered seraglio,",
  "Strutted the lordly turkey, and crowed the cock, with the selfsame",
  "Voice that in ages of old had startled the penitent Peter.",
  "Bursting with hay were the barns, themselves a village. In each one",
  "Far o'er the gable projected a roof of thatch; and a staircase,",
  "Under the sheltering eaves, led up to the odorous corn-loft.",
  "There too the dove-cot stood, with its meek and innocent inmates",
  "Murmuring ever of love; while above in the variant breezes",
  "Numberless noisy weathercocks rattled and sang of mutation.",
  "",
  "Thus, at peace with God and the world, the farmer of Grand-Pre",
  "Lived on his sunny farm, and Evangeline governed his household.",
  "Many a youth, as he knelt in the church and opened his missal,",
  "Fixed his eyes upon her as the saint of his deepest devotion;",
  "Happy was he who might touch her hand or the hem of her garment!",
  "Many a suitor came to her door, by the darkness befriended,",
  "And, as he knocked and waited to hear the sound of her footsteps,",
  "Knew not which beat the louder, his heart or the knocker of iron;",
  "Or at the joyous feast of the Patron Saint of the village,",
  "Bolder grew, and pressed her hand in the dance as he whispered",
  "Hurried words of love, that seemed a part of the music.",
  "But, among all who came, young Gabriel only was welcome;",
  "Gabriel Lajeunesse, the son of Basil the blacksmith,",
  "Who was a mighty man in the village, and honored of all men;",
  "For, since the birth of time, throughout all ages and nations,",
  "Has the craft of the smith been held in repute by the people.",
  "Basil was Benedict's friend. Their children from earliest childhood",
  "Grew up together as brother and sister; and Father Felician,",
  "Priest and pedagogue both in the village, had taught them their letters",
  "Out of the selfsame book, with the hymns of the church and the plain-song.",
  "But when the hymn was sung, and the daily lesson completed,",
  "Swiftly they hurried away to the forge of Basil the blacksmith.",
  "There at the door they stood, with wondering eyes to behold him",
  "Take in his leathern lap the hoof of the horse as a plaything,",
  "Nailing the shoe in its place; while near him the tire of the cart-wheel",
  "Lay like a fiery snake, coiled round in a circle of cinders.",
  "Oft on autumnal eves, when without in the gathering darkness",
  "Bursting with light seemed the smithy, through every cranny and crevice,",
  "Warm by the forge within they watched the laboring bellows,",
  "And as its panting ceased, and the sparks expired in the ashes,",
  "Merrily laughed, and said they were nuns going into the chapel.",
  "Oft on sledges in winter, as swift as the swoop of the eagle,",
  "Down the hillside hounding, they glided away o'er the meadow.",
  "Oft in the barns they climbed to the populous nests on the rafters,",
  "Seeking with eager eyes that wondrous stone, which the swallow",
  "Brings from the shore of the sea to restore the sight of its fledglings;",
  "Lucky was he who found that stone in the nest of the swallow!",
  "Thus passed a few swift years, and they no longer were children.",
  "He was a valiant youth, and his face, like the face of the morning,",
  "Gladdened the earth with its light, and ripened thought into action.",
  "She was a woman now, with the heart and hopes of a woman.",
  "\"Sunshine of Saint Eulalie\" was she called; for that was the sunshine",
  "Which, as the farmers believed, would load their orchards with apples",
  "She, too, would bring to her husband's house delight and abundance,",
  "Filling it full of love and the ruddy faces of children.",
  "",

  "II",
  "",
  "Now had the season returned, when the nights grow colder and longer,",
  "And the retreating sun the sign of the Scorpion enters.",
  "Birds of passage sailed through the leaden air, from the ice-bound,",
  "Desolate northern bays to the shores of tropical islands,",
  "Harvests were gathered in; and wild with the winds of September",
  "Wrestled the trees of the forest, as Jacob of old with the angel.",
  "All the signs foretold a winter long and inclement.",
  "Bees, with prophetic instinct of want, had hoarded their honey",
  "Till the hives overflowed; and the Indian bunters asserted",
  "Cold would the winter be, for thick was the fur of the foxes.",
  "Such was the advent of autumn. Then followed that beautiful season,",
  "Called by the pious Acadian peasants the Summer of All-Saints!",
  "Filled was the air with a dreamy and magical light; and the landscape",
  "Lay as if new-created in all the freshness of childhood.",
  "Peace seemed to reign upon earth, and the restless heart of the ocean",
  "Was for a moment consoled. All sounds were in harmony blended.",
  "Voices of children at play, the crowing of cocks in the farm-yards,",
  "Whir of wings in the drowsy air, and the cooing of pigeons,",
  "All were subdued and low as the murmurs of love, and the great sun",
  "Looked with the eye of love through the golden vapors around him;",
  "While arrayed in its robes of russet and scarlet and yellow,",
  "Bright with the sheen of the dew, each glittering tree of the forest",
  "Flashed like the plane-tree the Persian adorned with mantles and jewels.",
  "",
  "Now recommenced the reign of rest and affection and stillness.",
  "Day with its burden and heat had departed, and twilight descending",
  "Brought back the evening star to the sky, and the herds to the homestead.",
  "Pawing the ground they came, and resting their necks on each other,",
  "And with their nostrils distended inhaling the freshness of evening.",
  "Foremost, bearing the bell, Evangeline's beautiful heifer,",
  "Proud of her snow-white hide, and the ribbon that waved from her collar,",
  "Quietly paced and slow, as if conscious of human affection.",
  "Then came the shepherd back with his bleating flocks from the seaside,",
  "Where was their favorite pasture. Behind them followed the watch-dog,",
  "Patient, full of importance, and grand in the pride of his instinct,",
  "Walking from side to side with a lordly air, and superbly",
  "Waving his bushy tail, and urging forward the stragglers;",
  "Regent of flocks was he when the shepherd slept; their protector,",
  "When from the forest at night, through the starry silence, the wolves howled.",
  "Late, with the rising moon, returned the wains from the marshes,",
  "Laden with briny hay, that filled the air with its odor.",
  "Cheerily neighed the steeds, with dew on their manes and their fetlocks,",
  "While aloft on their shoulders the wooden and ponderous saddles,",
  "Painted with brilliant dyes, and adorned with tassels of crimson,",
  "Nodded in bright array, like hollyhocks heavy with blossoms.",
  "Patiently stood the cows meanwhile, and yielded their udders",
  "Unto the milkmaid's hand; whilst loud and in regular cadence",
  "Into the sounding pails the foaming streamlets descended.",
  "Lowing of cattle and peals of laughter were heard in the farm-yard,",
  "Echoed back by the barns. Anon they sank into stillness;",
  "Heavily closed, with a jarring sound, the valves of the barn-doors,",
  "Rattled the wooden bars, and all for a season was silent.",
  "",
  "In-doors, warm by the wide-mouthed fireplace, idly the farmer",
  "Sat in his elbow-chair, and watched how the flames and the smoke-wreaths",
  "Struggled together like foes in a burning city. Behind him,",
  "Nodding and mocking along the wall, with gestures fantastic,",
  "Darted his own huge shadow, and vanished away into darkness.",
  "Faces, clumsily carved in oak, on the back of his arm-chair",
  "Laughed in the flickering light, and the pewter plates on the dresser",
  "Caught and reflected the flame, as shields of armies the sunshine.",
  "Fragments of song the old man sang, and carols of Christmas,",
  "Such as at home, in the olden time, his fathers before him",
  "Sang in their Norman orchards and bright Burgundian vineyards.",
  "Close at her father's side was the gentle Evangeline seated,",
  "Spinning flax for the loom, that stood in the corner behind her.",
  "Silent awhile were its treadles, at rest was its diligent shuttle,",
  "While the monotonous drone of the wheel, like the drone of a bagpipe,",
  "Followed the old man's songs and united the fragments together.",
  "As in a church, when the chant of the choir at intervals ceases,",
  "Footfalls are heard in the aisles, or words of the priest at the altar,",
  "So, in each pause of the song, with measured motion the clock clicked.",
  "",
  "Thus as they sat, there were footsteps heard, and, suddenly lifted,",
  "Sounded the wooden latch, and the door swung back on its hinges.",
  "Benedict knew by the hob-nailed shoes it was Basil the blacksmith,",
  "And by her beating heart Evangeline knew who was with him.",
  "\"Welcome!\" the farmer exclaimed, as their footsteps paused of the threshold.",
  "\"Welcome, Basil, my friend! Come, take thy place on the settle",
  "Close by the chimney-side, which is always empty without thee;",
  "Take from the shelf overhead thy pipe and the box of tobacco;",
  "Never so much thyself art thou as when through the curling",
  "Smoke of the pipe or the forge thy friendly and jovial face gleams",
  "Round and red as the harvest moon through the mist of the marshes.\"",
  "Then, with a smile of content, thus answered Basil the blacksmith,",
  "Taking with easy air the accustomed seat by the fireside:--",
  "\"Benedict Bellefontaine, thou hast ever thy jest and thy ballad!",
  "Ever in cheerfullest mood art thou, when others are filled with",
  "Gloomy forebodings of ill, and see only ruin before them.",
  "Happy art thou, as if every day thou hadst picked up a horseshoe.\"",
  "Pausing a moment, to take the pipe that Evangeline brought him,",
  "And with a coal from the embers had lighted, he slowly continued:--",
  "\"Four days now are passed since the English ships at their anchors",
  "Ride in the Gaspereau's mouth, with their cannon pointed against us.",
  "What their design may be is unknown; but all are commanded",
  "On the morrow to meet in the church, where his Majesty's mandate",
  "Will be proclaimed as law in the land. Alas! in the mean time",
  "Many surmises of evil alarm the hearts of the people.\"",
  "Then made answer the farmer:--\"Perhaps some friendlier purpose",
  "Brings these ships to our shores. Perhaps the harvests in England",
  "By untimely rains or untimelier heat have been blighted,",
  "And from our bursting barns they would feed their cattle and children.\"",
  "\"Not so thinketh the folk in the village,\" said, warmly, the blacksmith,",
  "Shaking his head, as in doubt; then, heaving a sigh, he continued:--",
  "\"Louisburg is not forgotten, nor Beau Sejour, nor Port Royal.",
  "Many already have fled to the forest, and lurk on its outskirts,",
  "Waiting with anxious hearts the dubious fate of to-morrow.",
  "Arms have been taken from us, and warlike weapons of all kinds;",
  "Nothing is left but the blacksmith's sledge and the scythe of the mower.\"",
  "Then with a pleasant smile made answer the jovial farmer:--",
  "\"Safer are we unarmed, in the midst of our flocks and our cornfields,",
  "Safer within these peaceful dikes, besieged by the ocean,",
  "Than our fathers in forts, besieged by the enemy's cannon.",
  "Fear no evil, my friend, and to-night may no shadow of sorrow",
  "Fall on this house and hearth; for this is the night of the contract.",
  "Built are the house and the barn. The merry lads of the village",
  "Strongly have built them and well; and, breaking the glebe round about them,",
  "Filled the barn with hay, and the house with food for a twelvemonth.",
  "Rene Leblanc will be here anon, with his papers and inkhorn.",
  "Shall we not then be glad, and rejoice in the joy of our children?\"",
  "As apart by the window she stood, with her hand in her lover's,",
  "Blushing Evangeline heard the words that her father had spoken,",
  "And, as they died on his lips, the worthy notary entered.",
  "",
  "",
  "",
  "III",
  "",
  "Bent like a laboring oar, that toils in the surf of the ocean,",
  "Bent, but not broken, by age was the form of the notary public;",
  "Shocks of yellow hair, like the silken floss of the maize, hung",
  "Over his shoulders; his forehead was high; and glasses with horn bows",
  "Sat astride on his nose, with a look of wisdom supernal.",
  "Father of twenty children was he, and more than a hundred",
  "Children's children rode on his knee, and heard his great watch tick.",
  "Four long years in the times of the war had he languished a captive,",
  "Suffering much in an old French fort as the friend of the English.",
  "Now, though warier grown, without all guile or suspicion,",
  "Ripe in wisdom was he, but patient, and simple, and childlike.",
  "He was beloved by all, and most of all by the children;",
  "For he told them tales of the Loup-garou in the forest,",
  "And of the goblin that came in the night to water the horses,",
  "And of the white Letiche, the ghost of a child who unchristened",
  "Died, and was doomed to haunt unseen the chambers of children;",
  "And how on Christmas eve the oxen talked in the stable,",
  "And how the fever was cured by a spider shut up in a nutshell,",
  "And of the marvellous powers of four-leaved clover and horseshoes,",
  "With whatsoever else was writ in the lore of the village.",
  "Then up rose from his seat by the fireside Basil the blacksmith,",
  "Knocked from his pipe the ashes, and slowly extending his right hand,",
  "\"Father Leblanc,\" he exclaimed, \"thou hast heard the talk in the village,",
  "And, perchance, canst tell us some news of these ships and their errand.\"",
  "Then with modest demeanor made answer the notary public,--",
  "\"Gossip enough have I heard, in sooth, yet am never the wiser;",
  "And what their errand may be I know not better than others.",
  "Yet am I not of those who imagine some evil intention",
  "Brings them here, for we are at peace; and why then molest us?\"",
  "\"God's name!\" shouted the hasty and somewhat irascible blacksmith;",
  "\"Must we in all things look for the how, and the why, and the wherefore?",
  "Daily injustice is done, and might is the right of the strongest!\"",
  "But, without heeding his warmth, continued the notary public,--",
  "\"Man is unjust, but God is just; and finally justice",
  "Triumphs; and well I remember a story, that often consoled me,",
  "When as a captive I lay in the old French fort at Port Royal.\"",
  "This was the old man's favorite tale, and he loved to repeat it",
  "When his neighbors complained that any injustice was done them.",
  "\"Once in an ancient city, whose name I no longer remember,",
  "Raised aloft on a column, a brazen statue of Justice",
  "Stood in the public square, upholding the scales in its left hand,",
  "And in its right a sword, as an emblem that justice presided",
  "Over the laws of the land, and the hearts and homes of the people.",
  "Even the birds had built their nests in the scales of the balance,",
  "Having no fear of the sword that flashed in the sunshine above them.",
  "But in the course of time the laws of the land were corrupted;",
  "Might took the place of right, and the weak were oppressed, and the mighty",
  "Ruled with an iron rod. Then it chanced in a nobleman's palace",
  "That a necklace of pearls was lost, and erelong a suspicion",
  "Fell on an orphan girl who lived as maid in the household.",
  "She, after form of trial condemned to die on the scaffold,",
  "Patiently met her doom at the foot of the statue of Justice.",
  "As to her Father in heaven her innocent spirit ascended,",
  "Lo! o'er the city a tempest rose; and the bolts of the thunder",
  "Smote the statue of bronze, and hurled in wrath from its left hand",
  "Down on the pavement below the clattering scales of the balance,",
  "And in the hollow thereof was found the nest of a magpie,",
  "Into whose clay-built walls the necklace of pearls was inwoven.\"",
  "Silenced, but not convinced, when the story was ended, the blacksmith",
  "Stood like a man who fain would speak, but findeth no language;",
  "All his thoughts were congealed into lines on his face, as the vapors",
  "Freeze in fantastic shapes on the window-panes in the winter.",
  "",
  "Then Evangeline lighted the brazen lamp on the table,",
  "Filled, till it overflowed, the pewter tankard with home-brewed",
  "Nut-brown ale, that was famed for its strength in the village of Grand-Pre;",
  "While from his pocket the notary drew his papers and inkhorn,",
  "Wrote with a steady hand the date and the age of the parties,",
  "Naming the dower of the bride in flocks of sheep and in cattle.",
  "Orderly all things proceeded, and duly and well were completed,",
  "And the great seal of the law was set like a sun on the margin.",
  "Then from his leathern pouch the farmer threw on the table",
  "Three times the old man's fee in solid pieces of silver;",
  "And the notary rising, and blessing the bride and the bridegroom,",
  "Lifted aloft the tankard of ale and drank to their welfare.",
  "Wiping the foam from his lip, he solemnly bowed and departed,",
  "While in silence the others sat and mused by the fireside,",
  "Till Evangeline brought the draught-board out of its corner.",
  "Soon was the game begun. In friendly contention the old men",
  "Laughed at each lucky hit, or unsuccessful manoeuver,",
  "Laughed when a man was crowned, or a breach was made in the king-row",
  "Meanwhile apart, in the twilight gloom of a window's embrasure,",
  "Sat the lovers, and whispered together, beholding the moon rise",
  "Over the pallid sea and the silvery mist of the meadows.",
  "Silently one by one, in the infinite meadows of heaven,",
  "Blossomed the lovely stars, the forget-me-nots of the angels.",
  "",
  "Thus was the evening passed. Anon the bell from the belfry",
  "Rang out the hour of nine, the village curfew, and straightway",
  "Rose the guests and departed; and silence reigned in the household.",
  "Many a farewell word and sweet good-night on the door-step",
  "Lingered long in Evangeline's heart, and filled it with gladness.",
  "Carefully then were covered the embers that glowed on the hearth-stone,",
  "And on the oaken stairs resounded the tread of the farmer.",
  "Soon with a soundless step the foot of Evangeline followed.",
  "Up the staircase moved a luminous space in the darkness,",
  "Lighted less by the lamp than the shining face of the maiden.",
  "Silent she passed the hall, and entered the door of her chamber.",
  "Simple that chamber was, with its curtains of white, and its clothes-press",
  "Ample and high, on whose spacious shelves were carefully folded",
  "Linen and woollen stuffs, by the hand of Evangeline woven.",
  "This was the precious dower she would bring to her husband in marriage,",
  "Better than flocks and herds, being proofs of her skill as a housewife.",
  "Soon she extinguished her lamp, for the mellow and radiant moonlight",
  "Streamed through the windows, and lighted the room, till the heart of the maiden",
  "Swelled and obeyed its power, like the tremulous tides of the ocean.",
  "Ah! she was fair, exceeding fair to behold, as she stood with",
  "Naked snow-white feet on the gleaming floor of her chamber!",
  "Little she dreamed that below, among the trees of the orchard,",
  "Waited her lover and watched for the gleam of her lamp and her shadow.",
  "Yet were her thoughts of him, and at times a feeling of sadness",
  "Passed o'er her soul, as the sailing shade of clouds in the moonlight",
  "Flitted across the floor and darkened the room for a moment.",
  "And, as she gazed from the window, she saw serenely the moon pass",
  "Forth from the folds of a cloud, and one star follow her footsteps,",
  "As out of Abraham's tent young Ishmael wandered with Hagar!",
  "",
  "",
  "IV",
  "",
  "Pleasantly rose next morn the sun on the village of Grand-Pre.",
  "Pleasantly gleamed in the soft, sweet air the Basin of Minas,",
  "Where the ships, with their wavering shadows, were riding at anchor.",
  "Life had long been astir in the village, and clamorous labor",
  "Knocked with its hundred hands at the golden gates of the morning.",
  "Now from the country around, from the farms and neighboring hamlets,",
  "Came in their holiday dresses the blithe Acadian peasants.",
  "Many a glad good-morrow and jocund laugh from the young folk",
  "Made the bright air brighter, as up from the numerous meadows,",
  "Where no path could be seen but the track of wheels in the greensward,",
  "Group after group appeared, and joined, or passed on the highway.",
  "Long ere noon, in the village all sounds of labor were silenced.",
  "Thronged were the streets with people; and noisy groups at the house-doors",
  "Sat in the cheerful sun, and rejoiced and gossiped together.",
  "Every house was an inn, where all were welcomed and feasted;",
  "For with this simple people, who lived like brothers together,",
  "All things were held in common, and what one had was another's.",
  "Yet under Benedict's roof hospitality seemed more abundant:",
  "For Evangeline stood among the guests of her father;",
  "Bright was her face with smiles, and words of welcome and gladness",
  "Fell from her beautiful lips, and blessed the cup as she gave it.",
  "",
  "Under the open sky, in the odorous air of the orchard,",
  "Stript of its golden fruit, was spread the feast of betrothal.",
  "There in the shade of the porch were the priest and the notary seated;",
  "There good Benedict sat, and sturdy Basil the blacksmith.",
  "Not far withdrawn from these, by the cider-press and the beehives,",
  "Michael the fiddler was placed, with the gayest of hearts and of waistcoats.",
  "Shadow and light from the leaves alternately played on his snow-white",
  "Hair, as it waved in the wind; and the jolly face of the fiddler",
  "Glowed like a living coal when the ashes are blown from the embers.",
  "Gayly the old man sang to the vibrant sound of his fiddle,",
  "Tous les Bourgeois de Chartres, and Le Carillon de Dunkerque,",
  "And anon with his wooden shoes beat time to the music.",
  "Merrily, merrily whirled the wheels of the dizzying dances",
  "Under the orchard-trees and down the path to the meadows;",
  "Old folk and young together, and children mingled among them.",
  "Fairest of all the maids was Evangeline, Benedict's daughter!",
  "Noblest of all the youths was Gabriel, son of the blacksmith!",
  "",
  "So passed the morning away. And lo! with a summons sonorous",
  "Sounded the bell from its tower, and over the meadows a drum beat.",
  "Thronged erelong was the church with men. Without, in the churchyard,",
  "Waited the women. They stood by the graves, and hung on the headstones",
  "Garlands of autumn-leaves and evergreens fresh from the forest.",
  "Then came the guard from the ships, and marching proudly among them",
  "Entered the sacred portal. With loud and dissonant clangor",
  "Echoed the sound of their brazen drums from ceiling and casement,--",

  "Under the feet a garden of flowers, and the bluest of heavens",
  "Bending above, and resting its dome on the walls of the forest.",
  "They who dwell there have named it the Eden of Louisiana.\"",
  "",
  "With these words of cheer they arose and continued their journey.",
  "Softly the evening came. The sun from the western horizon",
  "Like a magician extended his golden wand o'er the landscape;",
  "Twinkling vapors arose; and sky and water and forest",
  "Seemed all on fire at the touch, and melted and mingled together.",
  "Hanging between two skies, a cloud with edges of silver,",
  "Floated the boat, with its dripping oars, on the motionless water.",
  "Filled was Evangeline's heart with inexpressible sweetness.",
  "Touched by the magic spell, the sacred fountains of feeling",
  "Glowed with the light of love, as the skies and waters around her.",
  "Then from a neighboring thicket the mocking-bird, wildest of singers,",
  "Swinging aloft on a willow spray that hung o'er the water,",
  "Shook from his little throat such floods of delirious music,",
  "That the whole air and the woods and the waves seemed silent to listen.",
  "Plaintive at first were the tones and sad; then soaring to madness",
  "Seemed they to follow or guide the revel of frenzied Bacchantes.",
  "Single notes were then heard, in sorrowful, low lamentation;",
  "Till, having gathered them all, he flung them abroad in derision,",
  "As when, after a storm, a gust of wind through the tree-tops",
  "Shakes down the rattling rain in a crystal shower on the branches.",
  "With such a prelude as this, and hearts that throbbed with emotion,",
  "Slowly they entered the Teche, where it flows through the green Opelousas,",
  "And, through the amber air, above the crest of the woodland,",
  "Saw the column of smoke that arose from a neighboring dwelling;--",
  "Sounds of a horn they heard, and the distant lowing of cattle.",
  "",

  "III",
  "",
  "Near to the bank of the river, o'ershadowed by oaks, from whose branches",
  "Garlands of Spanish moss and of mystic mistletoe flaunted,",
  "Such as the Druids cut down with golden hatchets at Yule-tide,",
  "Stood, secluded and still, the house of the herdsman. A garden",
  "Girded it round about with a belt of luxuriant blossoms,",
  "Filling the air with fragrance. The house itself was of timbers",
  "Hewn from the cypress-tree, and carefully fitted together.",
  "Large and low was the roof; and on slender columns supported,",
  "Rose-wreathed, vine-encircled, a broad and spacious veranda,",
  "Haunt of the humming-bird and the bee, extended around it.",
  "At each end of the house, amid the flowers of the garden,",
  "Stationed the dove-cots were, as love's perpetual symbol,",
  "Scenes of endless wooing, and endless contentions of rivals.",
  "Silence reigned o'er the place. The line of shadow and sunshine",
  "Ran near the tops of the trees; but the house itself was in shadow,",
  "And from its chimney-top, ascending and slowly expanding",
  "Into the evening air, a thin blue column of smoke rose.",
  "In the rear of the house, from the garden gate, ran a pathway",
  "Through the great groves of oak to the skirts of the limitless prairie,",
  "Into whose sea of flowers the sun was slowly descending.",
  "Full in his track of light, like ships with shadowy canvas",
  "Hanging loose from their spars in a motionless calm in the tropics,",
  "Stood a cluster of trees, with tangled cordage of grapevines.",
  "",
  "Just where the woodlands met the flowery surf of the prairie,",
  "Mounted upon his horse, with Spanish saddle and stirrups,",
  "Sat a herdsman, arrayed in gaiters and doublet of deerskin.",
  "Broad and brown was the face that from under the Spanish sombrero",
  "Gazed on the peaceful scene, with the lordly look of its master.",
  "Round about him were numberless herds of kine, that were grazing",
  "Quietly in the meadows, and breathing the vapory freshness",
  "That uprose from the river, and spread itself over the landscape.",
  "Slowly lifting the horn that hung at his side, and expanding",
  "Fully his broad, deep chest, he blew a blast, that resounded",
  "Wildly and sweet and far, through the still damp air of the evening.",
  "Suddenly out of the grass the long white horns of the cattle",
  "Rose like flakes of foam on the adverse currents of ocean.",
  "Silent a moment they gazed, then bellowing rushed o'er the prairie,",
  "And the whole mass became a cloud, a shade in the distance.",
  "Then, as the herdsman turned to the house, through the gate of the garden",
  "Saw he the forms of the priest and the maiden advancing to meet him.",
  "Suddenly down from his horse he sprang in amazement, and forward",
  "Rushed with extended arms and exclamations of wonder;",
  "When they beheld his face, they recognized Basil the blacksmith.",
  "Hearty his welcome was, as he led his guests to the garden.",
  "There in an arbor of roses with endless question and answer",
  "Gave they vent to their hearts, and renewed their friendly embraces,",
  "Laughing and weeping by turns, or sitting silent and thoughtful.",
  "Thoughtful, for Gabriel came not; and now dark doubts and misgivings",
  "Stole o'er the maiden's heart; and Basil, somewhat embarrassed,",
  "Broke the silence and said, \"If you came by the Atchafalaya,",
  "How have you nowhere encountered my Gabriel's boat on the bayous?\"",
  "Over Evangeline's face at the words of Basil a shade passed.",
  "Tears came into her eyes, and she said, with a tremulous accent,",
  "\"Gone? is Gabriel gone?\" and, concealing her face on his shoulder,",
  "All her o'erburdened heart gave way, and she wept and lamented.",
  "Then the good Basil said,--and his voice grew blithe as he said it,--",
  "\"Be of good cheer, my child; it is only to-day he departed.",
  "Foolish boy! he has left me alone with my herds and my horses.",
  "Moody and restless grown, and tried and troubled, his spirit",
  "Could no longer endure the calm of this quiet existence.",
  "Thinking ever of thee, uncertain and sorrowful ever,",
  "Ever silent, or speaking only of thee and his troubles,",
  "He at length had become so tedious to men and to maidens,",
  "Tedious even to me, that at length I bethought me, and sent him",
  "Unto the town of Adayes to trade for mules with the Spaniards.",
  "Thence he will follow the Indian trails to the Ozark Mountains,",
  "Hunting for furs in the forests, on rivers trapping the beaver.",
  "Therefore be of good cheer; we will follow the fugitive lover;",
  "He is not far on his way, and the Fates and the streams are against him.",
  "Up and away to-morrow, and through the red dew of the morning",
  "We will follow him fast, and bring him back to his prison.\"",
  "",
  "Then glad voices were heard, and up from the banks of the river,",
  "Borne aloft on his comrades' arms, came Michael the fiddler.",
  "Long under Basil's roof had he lived like a god on Olympus,",
  "Having no other care than dispensing music to mortals.",
  "Far renowned was he for his silver locks and his fiddle.",
  "\"Long live Michael,\" they cried, \"our brave Acadian minstrel!\"",
  "As they bore him aloft in triumphal procession; and straightway",
  "Father Felician advanced with Evangeline, greeting the old man",
  "Kindly and oft, and recalling the past, while Basil, enraptured,",
  "Hailed with hilarious joy his old companions and gossips,",
  "Laughing loud and long, and embracing mothers and daughters.",
  "Much they marvelled to see the wealth of the cidevant blacksmith,",
  "All his domains and his herds, and his patriarchal demeanor;",
  "Much they marvelled to hear his tales of the soil and the climate,",
  "And of the prairie; whose numberless herds were his who would take them;",
  "Each one thought in his heart, that he, too, would go and do likewise.",
  "Thus they ascended the steps, and, crossing the breezy veranda,",
  "Entered the hall of the house, where already the supper of Basil",
  "Waited his late return; and they rested and feasted together.",
  "",
  "Over the joyous feast the sudden darkness descended.",
  "All was silent without, and, illuming the landscape with silver,",
  "Fair rose the dewy moon and the myriad stars; but within doors,",
  "Brighter than these, shone the faces of friends in the glimmering lamplight.",
  "Then from his station aloft, at the head of the table, the herdsman",
  "Poured forth his heart and his wine together in endless profusion.",
  "Lighting his pipe, that was filled with sweet Natchitoches tobacco,",
  "Thus he spake to his guests, who listened, and smiled as they listened:--",
  "\"Welcome once more, my friends, who long have been friendless and homeless,",
  "Welcome once more to a home, that is better perchance than the old one!",
  "Here no hungry winter congeals our blood like the rivers;",
  "Here no stony ground provokes the wrath of the farmer.",
  "Smoothly the ploughshare runs through the soil, as a keel through the water.",
  "All the year round the orange-groves are in blossom; and grass grows",
  "More in a single night than a whole Canadian summer.",
  "Here, too, numberless herds run wild and unclaimed in the prairies;",
  "Here, too, lands may be had for the asking, and forests of timber",
  "With a few blows of the axe are hewn and framed into houses.",
  "After your houses are built, and your fields are yellow with harvests,",
  "No King George of England shall drive you away from your homesteads,",
  "Burning your dwellings and barns, and stealing your farms and your cattle.\"",
  "Speaking these words, he blew a wrathful cloud from his nostrils,",
  "While his huge, brown hand came thundering down on the table,",
  "So that the guests all started; and",
